HierarchyMap algorithm is a new ordered treemap algorithm. Results of the implementation of HierarchyMap treemap algorithm show that it is capable of representing several thousands of hierarchical data on 2-dimensional space on a computer and Portable Device Application (PDA) screens while still maintaining the qualities found in existing treemap algorithms such as readability, low aspect ratio, reduced run time, and reduced number of thin rectangles.

  title = {Trevis: A context tree visualization and analysis framework and its use for classifying performance failure reports},
  pages = {73--82},
  abstract = {When developers profile their applications to identify performance problems, they normally use profilers producing calling context trees. A calling context tree (CCT) represents the caller-callee relationships of a program. A dynamically collected CCT provides method coverage information. The CCTs produced by profilers also include method hotness information. Trevis, our context tree visualization and analysis framework, allows users to visualize, compare, cluster, and intersect CCTs produced by profilers. We evaluate Trevis in the context of a novel profiling tool called FlyBy. FlyBy runs transparently on an end-user's computer and continuously samples the applications' call stack. When the user perceives the application as sluggish, she presses a "Was Slow!" button to tell FlyBy to file a performance failure report. The report contains the CCT based on the call stack samples FlyBy gathered over the last few seconds before the user pressed the button. We show how Trevis allows us to visualize and classify FlyBy bug reports.},

  abstract = {The emergence of very large hierarchies that result from the increase in available data raises many problems of visualization and navigation. On data sets of such scale, classical graph drawing methods do not take advantage of certain human cognitive skills such as shape recognition. These cognitive skills could make it easier to remember the global structure of the data. In this paper, we propose a method that is based on the use of nested irregular shapes. We name it GosperMap as we rely on the use of a Gosper Curve to generate these shapes. By employing human perception mechanisms that were developed by handling, for example, cartographic maps, this technique facilitates the visualization and navigation of a hierarchy. An algorithm has been designed to preserve region containment according to the hierarchy and to set the leaves' sizes proportionally to a property, in such a way that the size of nonleaf regions corresponds to the sum of their children's sizes. Moreover, the input ordering of the hierarchy's nodes is preserved, i.e., the areas that represent two consecutive children of a node in the hierarchy are adjacent to one another. This property is especially useful because it guarantees some stability in our algorithm. We illustrate our technique by providing visualization examples of the repartition of tax money in the US over time. Furthermore, we validate the use of the GosperMap in a professional documentation context and show the stability and ease of memorization for this type of map.},

We restrict the number of directions used for the edges from each node to its children from one to five, and to five patterns: straight, Y, psi, X, and full. The psi-drawings generalize hv- or strictly upward drawings to ternary trees. We show that complete ternary trees have a psi-drawing on a square of size and general ternary trees can be drawn within area. Both bounds are optimal. Sub-quadratic bounds are also obtained for X-pattern drawings of complete tetra trees, and for full-pattern drawings of complete penta trees, which are 4-ary and 5-ary trees. These results parallel and complement the ones of Frati for straight-line orthogonal drawings of ternary trees. Moreover, we provide an algorithm for compacted straight-line drawings of penta trees on the hexagonal grid, such that the direction of the edges from a node to its children is given by our patterns and these edges have the same length. However, drawing trees on a hexagonal grid within a prescribed area or with unit length edges is NP-hard.},

  pages = {87--92},
  abstract = {As the amount of electronic information explodes, hierarchies to handle this information become huge and complex. Visualizing and interacting with these hierarchies become daunting tasks. The problem is exacerbated if the visualization is to be done on massmarket personal computers, with limited processing power and visual resolution. Many of the current visualization techniques work effectively for hierarchies of 1000 nodes. But as the number of nodes increases toward 5000 nodes, these techniques tend to break down. Hierarchies above 5000 nodes usually require special modifications such as clustering, which can affect visual stability. This paper introduces Cheops, a novel approach to the representation, browsing and exploration of huge, complex information hierarchies such as the Dewey Decimal system, which can contain between 1 million and 1 billion nodes. The Cheops approach maintains context within a huge hierarchy, while simultaneously providing easy access to details. This paper will also present some preliminary results from usability tests performed on an 8 wide by 9 deep classification hierarchy, which if fully populated would contain over 19 million nodes.},

Although any hierarchy can be modeled as a binary one by subsequently dividing n-ary branches into a sequence of n-1 binary branches, we follow a different strategy. In our approach extending Pythagoras Trees to arbitrarily branching trees, we only need a single visual element for an n-ary branch instead of spreading the binary branches along a strand. Each vertex in the hierarchy is visualized as a rectangle sized according to a metric. We analyze several visual parameters such as length, width, order, and color of the nodes against the use of different metrics.

PhotoMesa groups images using one of two new algorithms that lay out groups of objects in a 2D space-filling manner. Quantum treemaps are designed for laying out images or other objects of indivisible (quantum) size. They are a variation on existing treemap algorithms in that they guarantee that every generated rectangle will have a width and height that are an integral multiple of an input object size. Bubblemaps also fill space with groups of quantum-sized objects, but generate non-rectangular blobs, and utilize space more efficiently.},

  abstract = {Treemaps, a space-filling method for visualizing large hierarchical data sets, are receiving increasing attention. Several algorithms have been previously proposed to create more useful displays by controlling the aspect ratios of the rectangles that make up a treemap. While these algorithms do improve visibility of small items in a single layout, they introduce instability over time in the display of dynamically changing data, fail to preserve order of the underlying data, and create layouts that are difficult to visually search. In addition, continuous treemap algorithms are not suitable for displaying fixed-sized objects within them, such as images.This paper introduces a new "strip" treemap algorithm which addresses these shortcomings, and analyzes other "pivot" algorithms we recently developed showing the trade-offs between them. These ordered treemap algorithms ensure that items near each other in the given order will be near each other in the treemap layout. Using experimental evidence from Monte Carlo trials and from actual stock market data, we show that, compared to other layout algorithms, ordered treemaps are more stable, while maintaining relatively favorable aspect ratios of the constituent rectangles. A user study with 20 participants clarifies the human performance benefits of the new algorithms. Finally, we present quantum treemap algorithms, which modify the layout of the continuous treemap algorithms to generate rectangles that are integral multiples of an input object size. The quantum treemap algorithm has been applied to PhotoMesa, an application that supports browsing of large numbers of images.},

The graphical representation may be a tree hierarchy including a plurality of expandable and collapsible nodes. The method begins as the hierarchy is displayed within a primary display window on the display screen when the user selects a node to be expanded . In response, a first display region is output within the primary display window and includes a set of one or more subnodes associated with the selected node. If a first subnode in the first display region is then selected for expansion, a second display region is then output within the first display region, and the second display region in turn includes a set of one or more subnodes of the first subnode. This generation of new "nested" display regions then continues as the user continues to explore deeper into the tree hierarchy. A given subnode display region may have one or more controls, such as a sizing button or one or more scroll bars, to facilitate display of node information within the region, and preferably each expanded node remains associated with its subnode display region using a guideline. If generation and display of a subnode display region requires additional screen space, one or more of the subnodes in the "parent" display region are re-positioned.},

Furthermore, we consider rectilinear partitions, which retain more of the schematized flavor of standard rectangular treemaps. Our rectilinear treemaps have constant aspect ratio, independent of $\depth(\tree)$ or the number and weight of the nodes. The leaves of $\tree$ are represented by rectangles, L-, and S-shapes and internal nodes by orthoconvex polygons. We also consider the important special case that $\depth(\tree)=1$, that is, single-level treemaps. We prove that it is strongly NP-hard to minimize the aspect ratio of a rectangular single-level treemap. On the positive side we show how to construct rectilinear and convex single-level treemaps with constant aspect ratio. Our rectilinear single-level treemaps use only rectangles and L-shapes and have aspect ratio at most $2 + 2 \sqrt{3}/3$. The convex version uses four different octilinear shapes and has aspect ratio at most 9/2.},

The popular Treemap algorithm visualizes such a tree as a hierarchical partition of a square into rectangles, where the area of the rectangle corresponding to any node in T is equal to the weight of that node. The aspect ratio of the rectangles in such a rectangular partition necessarily depends on the weights and can become arbitrarily high. We introduce a new hierarchical partition scheme, called a polygonal partition, which uses convex polygons rather than just rectangles. We present two methods for constructing polygonal partitions, both having guarantees on the worst-case aspect ratio of the constructed polygons; in particular, both methods guarantee a bound on the aspect ratio that is independent of the weights of the nodes. We also consider rectangular partitions with slack, where the areas of the rectangles may differ slightly from the weights of the corresponding nodes. We show that this makes it possible to obtain partitions with constant aspect ratio. This result generalizes to hyper-rectangular partitions in $R^d$. We use these partitions with slack for embedding ultrametrics into d-dimensional Euclidean space:  we give a polylog(delta)-approximation algorithm for embedding n-point ultrametrics into $R^d$ with minimum distortion, where delta denotes the spread of the metric. The previously best-known approximation ratio for this problem was polynomial in n. This is the first algorithm for embedding a non-trivial family of weighted-graph metrics into a space of constant dimension that achieves polylogarithmic approximation ratio.},

The status of each process running, sleeping, stopped, etc., can be indicated by different colors. Different users can appear as different colors too. Process selection can be made per user, all users, or through a regular-expression pattern. In contrast to the terminal-based pstree or tree-widget based programs, the tree display uses diagonal lines, and effort is made to effectively use the full 2-dimensional area of the screen by balancing levels and centering the children of a node between their parent. A goal of the program is to give an idea of what's going on graphically as things may be constantly changing. Therefore the display algorithm tries to keep processes close to their parents to reduce the amount of scrolling to see localized process creation and destruction. Some effort is also given to make sure that the tree layout doesn't get wildly reorganized when there are small or localized changes. This makes it easier for the eye to pick up and recognize the changes over a potentially large display area. We describe here criteria for tree animations such as this one and how the xps layout algorithm works. There are some other miscellaneous features of xps. One can select viewing the processes by a single user, a regular expression for users, by all users, and perhaps show kernel processes. One can click on a process to get more information (via ps or a user-specified program) about that process, send a signal, or set the process priority, assuming you have the permission to do so. Since programs of this ilk can consume a bit of CPU on their own, some effort has been made to turn off the update process when the program is iconified or not visible for some other reason such as being obscured by another window. Some attention has been paid to make algorithm display fairly fast in most situations, although it has to be admitted that this comes sometimes at the expense of a nicer layout.},

The resulting model is integrated into an approach called Smart- Layouting. This approach is evaluated on real-world data from 100 publicly available software repositories. Compared to other state-of-the-art treemap algorithms it reaches an overall better result. Additionally, this approach can be customized by an end user's needs. The customization allows for specifying weights for the importance of each layout-quality metric.

This approach offers an order of area improvement over the existing single stretch layout mixing approaches, while retaining identical boundary-I/O.

StepTree is similar to the hierarchy-visualization tool, Treemap, in that it uses a rectangular, space-filling methodology, but differs from Treemap in that it employs three-dimensional space, which is used to more clearly convey the structural relationships of the hierarchy. The paper includes an empirical study comparing typical search and analysis tasks using StepTree and Treemap. The study shows that users perform significantly better on tasks related to interpreting structural relationships when using StepTree. In addition, users achieved the same performance with StepTree and Treemap when doing a range of other common interpretative and navigational tasks.},

However, most studies have mainly focused on layout algorithms and paid limited attention to the interaction with treemaps.

We propose the notion of zoomable treemaps (ZTMs), an hybridization between treemaps and zoomable user interfaces that facilitates the navigation in large hierarchical data sets. By providing a consistent set of interaction techniques, ZTMs make it possible for users to browse through very large data sets (e.g., 700,000 nodes dispatched amongst 13 levels). These techniques use the structure of the displayed data to guide the interaction and provide a way to improve interactive navigation in treemaps.},

Dendrogramix enables users to do tasks which involve both clusters and individual objects that are impracticable with the classical representation, like: to explain why a particular objects belongs to a particular cluster; to elicit and understand uncommon patterns (e.g., objects that could have been classified in a totally different cluster); etc. Those sensemaking tasks are supported by a consistent set of interaction techniques that facilitates the exploration of large clustering results.},

  abstract = {Bayesian analysis through programs like BEAST (Drummond and Rumbaut, 2007) and MrBayes (Huelsenbeck et al., 2001) provides a powerful method for reconstruction of evolutionary relationships. One of the benefits of Bayesian methods is that well-founded estimates of uncertainty in models can be made available. So, for example, not only the mean time of a most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) is estimated, but also the spread. This distribution over model space is represented by a set of trees, which can be rather large and difficult to interpret. DensiTree is a tool that helps navigating these sets of trees. The main idea behind DensiTree is to draw all trees in the set transparently. As a result, areas where a lot of the trees agree in topology and branch lengths show up as highly colored areas, while areas with little agreement show up as webs. This makes it possible to quickly get an impression of properties of the tree set such as well-supported clades, distribution of tMRCA and areas of topological uncertainty. Thus, DensiTree provides a quick method for qualitative analysis of tree sets.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic analysis like Bayesian MCMC or bootstrapping result in a collection of trees. Trees are discrete objects and it is generally difficult to get a mental grip on a distributions over trees. Visualisation tools like DensiTree can give good intuition on tree distributions. It works by drawing all trees in the set transparently thus highlighting areas where the tree in the set agrees. In this way, both uncertainty in clade heights and uncertainty in topology can be visualised. In our experience, a vanilla DensiTree can turn out to be misleading in that it shows too much uncertainty due to wrongly ordering taxa or due to unlucky placement of internal nodes. DensiTree is extended to allow visualisation of meta-data associated with branches such as population size and evolutionary rates. Furthermore, geographic locations of taxa can be shown on a map, making it easy to visually check there is some geographic pattern in a phylogeny. Taxa orderings have a large impact on the layout of the tree set, and advances have been made in finding better orderings resulting in significantly more informative visualisations. We also explored various methods for positioning internal nodes, which can improve the quality of the image. Together, these advances make it easier to comprehend distributions over trees.},

Resulting Multilevel Silhouette Tree (MuSi-Tree) has a specific structure called multilevel compound tree. This work builds upon previous work on a compound tree structure called MO-Tree. The work presented in this paper is a major improvement over previous work by (1) defining multilevel compound tree as a more generic structure, (2) proposing original space-filling visualization techniques to display it, (3) defining relevant interaction model based on both focus changes and graph filtering techniques and (4) reporting from case studies in various fields: co-citation graphs, related-document graphs and social graphs.},

  abstract = {Various algorithms have been proposed for the difficult problem of producing aesthetically pleasing drawings of trees, see Reingold and Tilford (1981), Wetherell and Shannon (1979) but implementations only exist as ``special purpose software'', designed for special environments. Therefore, many users resort to the drawing facilites available on most personal computers, but the figures obtained in this way still look ``hand-drawn''; their quality is inferior to the quality of the surrounding text that can be realized by today''s high quality text processing systems. In this paper we present an entirely new solution that integrates a tree drawing algorithm into one of the best text processing systems available. More precisely, we present a TeX macro package TreeTeX that produces a drawing of a tree from a purely logical description. Our approach has three advantages. First, labels for nodes can be handled in a reasonable way. On the one hand, the tree drawing algorithm can compute the widths of the labels and take them into account for the positioning of the nodes; on the other hand, all the textual parts of the document can be treated uniformly. Second, TreeTeX can be trivially ported to any site running TeX. Finally, modularity in the description of a tree and TeX's macro capabilities allow for libraries of subtrees and tree classes. In addition, we have implemented an option that produces drawing which make the structure of the trees more obvious to the human eye, even though they may not be as aesthetically pleasing.},

  abstract = {Rectangular layouts, subdivisions of an outer rectangle into smaller rectangles, have many applications in visualizing spatial information, for instance in rectangular cartograms in which the rectangles represent geographic or political regions. A spatial treemap is a rectangular layout with a hierarchical structure: the outer rectangle is subdivided into rectangles that are in turn subdivided into smaller rectangles. We describe algorithms for transforming a rectangular layout that does not have this hierarchical structure, together with a clustering of the rectangles of the layout, into a spatial treemap that respects the clustering and also respects to the extent possible the adjacencies of the input layout.},

One or more sources are connected to several targets by arcs whose thickness corresponds to the amount of flow between a source and a target. Flow maps reduce visual clutter by merging (bundling) lines smoothly and by avoiding self-intersections. We present algorithms that compute crossing-free flows of high visual quality. To this end we introduce a new variant of the geometric Steiner arborescence problem. The goal is to connect the targets to a source with a tree of minimal length whose arcs obey a certain restriction on the angle they form with the source. Such an angle-restricted Steiner arborescence, or simply flow tree, naturally induces a clustering on the targets and smoothly bundles arcs. We study the properties of optimal flow trees and show that they consist of logarithmic spirals and straight lines. Computing optimal flow trees is NP-hard. Hence we consider a variant of flow trees which uses only logarithmic spirals, so called spiral trees. Spiral trees approximate flow trees within a factor depending on the angle restriction. Computing optimal spiral trees remains NP-hard. We present an efficient 2-approximation for spiral trees, which can be extended to avoid certain types of obstacles.},

Good flow maps reduce visual clutter by merging (bundling) lines smoothly and by avoiding self-intersections. Most flow maps are still drawn by hand and only few automated methods exist. Some of the known algorithms do not support edge-bundling and those that do, cannot guarantee crossing-free flows. We present a new algorithmic method that uses edge-bundling and computes crossing-free flows of high visual quality. Our method is based on so-called spiral trees, a novel type of Steiner tree which uses logarithmic spirals. Spiral trees naturally induce a clustering on the targets and smoothly bundle lines. Our flows can also avoid obstacles, such as map features, region outlines, or even the targets. We validate our approach with extensive experiments.},

  title = {{Timeline Trees}: visualizing sequences of transactions in information hierarchies},
  pages = {75--82},
  abstract = {In many applications transactions between the elements of an information hierarchy occur over time. For example, the product offers of a department store can be organized into product groups and subgroups to form an information hierarchy. A market basket consisting of the products bought by a customer forms a transaction. Market baskets of one or more customers can be ordered by time into a sequence of transactions. Each item in a transaction is associated with a measure, for example, the amount paid for a product. In this paper we present a novel method for visualizing sequences of these kinds of transactions in information hierarchies. It uses a tree layout to draw the hierarchy and a timeline to represent progression of transactions in the hierarchy. We have developed several interaction techniques that allow the users to explore the data. Smooth animations help them to track the transitions between views. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated by examples from several very different application domains.},

It is inspired by the visual metaphor of indented outlines, omnipresent in graphical file browsers and pretty printing of source code. Inner vertices are represented as vertically arranged lines and leaf groups as horizontally arranged lines. A recursive layout algorithm places parent nodes to the left side of their underlying tree structure and leaves of each subtree grouped to the rightmost position. Edges are represented only implicitly by the vertically and horizontally aligned structure of the plot, leading to a sparse and redundant-free visual representation. We conducted a user study with 30 subjects in that we compared IPTPs and node-link diagrams as a within-subjects variable. The study indicates that working with IPTPs can be learned in less than 10 minutes. Moreover, IPTPs are as effective as node-link diagrams for accuracy and completion time for three typical tasks; participants generally preferred IPTPs. We demonstrate the usefulness of IPTPs by understanding hierarchical features of huge trees such as the NCBI taxonomy with more than 300,000 nodes.},

Our TimeEdgeTrees tool allows us to explore dynamic quantitative data in tree diagrams by interactive data filtering and zooming. The spatial proximity of neighboring hierarchically structured elements allows us to easily explore trends, countertrends, periodicity, temporal shifts, or anomalies during the evolution synchronously. Interactive features such as expanding or collapsing of subhierarchies additionally help to detect the aforementioned phenomena on different levels of granularity. The usefulness of our visualization technique is illustrated by water level data acquired at more than 450 measurement stations along German rivers for 768 points in time.},

We exploit the indented visual metaphor to map tree structures to one-dimensional zigzag curves to primarily achieve an overview representation for the entire hierarchy. We focus on space-efficiency and simultaneous uncovering of tree-specific phenomena. Each displayed plot can be filtered for substructures that are mapped to a larger space and hence, unhide more fine-granular substructures that are hidden in the compressed overview. By representing tree structures side-by-side, the viewer can easily compare them visually and detect similar patterns and also anomalies. In our approach, we follow the information seeking mantra: overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand. More interactive features such as expanding and collapsing of nodes, applying different color codings, or distorting the tree horizontally as well as vertically support a viewer when exploring huge hierarchical data sets. The usefulness of our interactive browsing tool is demonstrated in a case study for the NCBI taxonomy that contains 324,276 species and organisms that are hierarchically organized.},

  abstract = {Indented Pixel Tree Plots are useful for an overview of large and deep hierarchical data. As a major benefit, these plots scale to pixel or even subpixel resolution, still clearly visualizing the hierarchical structures and substructures in a redundant-free representation. Consequently, there is display space available that may be used to show additional information such as enlarged or filtered subregions, details-on-demand, or control panels. In this paper, we demonstrate how this compact indented diagram can be enriched with additional data associated with both leaf and inner nodes of the hierarchy. To this end, we support quantitative, categorical, relational, and time-series data. By such a combination, exploration and analysis of visual patterns and anomalies on different levels of hierarchical granularity are possible in a static diagram. Furthermore, interactive features such as expanding/collapsing of subhierarchies, horizontal/vertical distortions, zooming in/out, or details-on-demand are integrated to allow the user to inspect the data from different viewpoints. The usefulness of the enriched diagrams is illustrated by applying them to file system data where single software constructs are hierarchically organized. Here, we focus on quantitative, categorical, and relational data attached to the nodes of the hierarchy. In a second case study, we demonstrate how evolving water level data of rivers in Germany can be represented by our plots.},

We introduce TimeTree, a novel visualization tool designed to enable exploration of a changing hierarchy. TimeTree enables analysts to navigate the history of an organization, identify events associated with a specific entity (visualized on a TimeSlider), and explore an aggregate view of an individual's career path (a CareerTree). We demonstrate the utility of TimeTree by investigating a set of scenarios developed by an expert intelligence analyst.

Existing systems for visualizing huge hierarchies using cone trees "break down" once the hierarchy to be displayed exceeds roughly 1000 nodes, due to increasing visual clutter. The paper describes a system called fsviz which visualizes arbitrarily large hierarchies while retaining user control. This is accomplished by augmenting cone trees with several graphical and interaction techniques: usage-based filtering, animated zooming, hand-coupled rotation, fish-eye zooming, coalescing of distant nodes, texturing, effective use of colour for depth cueing, and the applications of dynamic queries. The fsviz system also improves upon earlier cone tree visualization systems through a more elaborate node layout algorithm. This algorithm enhances the usefulness of cone tree visualization for large hierarchies by all but eliminating clutter.},

  abstract = {Treemap, a common information visualization approach for dividing a display area into nested rectangles, has a good performance on visualizing hierarchical data. And it enables user to compare nodes in the same level and to learn certain relationship between adjacent levels. However, treemap layout is limited to visualize multi-dimensional hierarchical data in which the hierarchy is unfixed and complex, especially when the hierarchy is an arbitrary graph. Considering this problem, we present a novel extension called magic treemap cube, which improves the layout and has a good performance on visualizing unfixed (cross-level) and complex data, inverting hierarchy without reorganizing the structure, and enabling users to easily compare among treemaps. The magic treemap cube is a three-dimensional regular hexahedron whose six faces are covered by six different treemaps. Each dimension of the magic treemap cube is a hierarchy structure specified by users according to a hierarchical division of visualization information. With the treemap algorithm, tagcloud and mapping rules, the treemaps are automatically controlled by permutations of three dimensions of the cube. Users could observe the six correlative treemaps respectively by rotating the magic treemap cube in three dimensional Cartesian coordinate. And this magic treemap cube can be unfolded into a tiled treemap in 2D Cartesian coordinate for users-friendly comparison of each treemap. Meanwhile, a merging operation to the tiled treemap is proposed to not only compare two treemaps through the adjacency relations among faces but also provide more information.

  abstract = {According to the characteristics of pesticide residue data and analyzing requirements in food safety fields, we presented a visual analyzing method for associated hierarchical data, called sunburst with ordered nodes based on hierarchical clustering (SONHC). SONHC arranged the leaf nodes in sunburst in order using hierarchical clustering algorithm, put the associated dataset as a node in center of the sunburst, and connected it with the associated leaf nodes in sunburst using colored lines. So, it can present not only two hierarchical structures but also the relationships between them. Based on SONHC and some interaction techniques (clicking, contraction and expansion, etc) we developed an associated visual analyzing system (AVAS) for pesticide residues detection results data, which can help users to inspect the hierarchical structure of pesticide and agricultural products and to explore the associations between pesticides and agricultural products, and associations between different pesticides. The results of user experience test showed that SONHC algorithm overperforms than SA and SR algorithm in ULE and ULEs variance. AVAS system is effective in helping users to analyze the pesticide residues data. Furthermore, SONHC algorithm can also be adopted to analyze associated hierarchical data in other fields, such as finance, insurance and e-commerce.},

First, we extract an annotated syntax tree (AST) from each version of a given C++ source code. Next, we hash the extracted syntax nodes based on a metric combining structure and type information, and construct matches (correspondences) between similar-hash subtrees. Our technique detects code fragments which have not changed, or changed little, during the software evolution. By parameterizing the similarity metric, we can flexibly decide what is considered to be identical or not during the software evolution. Finally, we visualize the evolution of the code structure by emphasizing both changing and constant code patterns. We demonstrate our technique on a versioned code base containing a variety of changes ranging from simple to complex.},

Qualitative results, however, indicate that the subjects were enthusiastic about the cone tree visualization and that they felt it provided a better 'feel' for the structure of the information space.},

An h-v drawing of a binary tree t is a drawing of t such that (a) nodes are points with integer coordinates, (b) each edge is either a rightward-horizontal or a downward-vertical straight-line segment from a node to one of its children, (c) edges do not intersect, and (d) if t 1 and t 2 are immediate subtrees of a node u, the enclosing rectangles of the drawings of t 1 and t 2 are disjoint. We prove that, for any complete binary tree t of height h SQRT((n+1)/2)+3.5 if h is odd, (b) 2.5n3.25SQRT(n+1)+3.5 otherwise. As far as we know, this is one of the few examples in which a closed formula for the minimum-area drawing of a graph has been explicitly found. Furthermore this minimum-area h-v drawing can be constructed in linear time. As a consequence of this result and the result of Trevisan (1996), we have that h-v drawings are provably less area-efficient than strictly upward drawings when we restrict ourselves to complete binary trees. We also give analogous results for the minimum-perimeter and the minimum-enclosing square area h-v drawings.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a prototype called CoMem (Corporate Memory) that supports the finding and understanding of useful items in large hierarchical repositories. The particular domain is civil engineering design, and the prototype is designed specifically to support design reuse in building construction projects. However, the underlying visualization and interaction principals behind CoMem are generalizable to the ubiquitous task of finding and understanding useful information in large hierarchical repositories. To support the finding, the entire hierarchy is visualized using a squarified treemap. Once an item from the treemap is selected, CoMem supports the understanding of that item by identifying related items in the hierarchy and visualizing the selected item in the context of these related items in a node-link diagram. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of a usability evaluation of CoMem that supports the claim that finding and understanding improve the process of reuse, and that the described visualizations assist with finding and understanding.},

We propose a single, compact view of all class hierarchies at once using a custom Sunburst layout. It enables to quickly discover interesting facts across classes while preserving the essential relationship between parent and children classes. We explain how standard inheritance metrics are mapped into our visualization. Additionally, we define a new metric characterizing similar children classes. Using these metrics and the proposed layout, a set of common visual patterns is derived. These patterns allow the programmer to quickly understand how inheritance is used and provide answers to some essential questions when performing program comprehension tasks. Our approach is evaluated through a case study that involves examples from large programs, demonstrating its scalability.},

Huge efforts are made to assemble such a large tree, helped by the decrease of sequencing costs and improved methods to reconstruct and combine phylogenies, but no tool exists today to explore the ToL in its entirety in a satisfying manner. By combining methods used in modern cartography, such as OpenStreetMap, with a new way of representing tree-like structures, I created Lifemap, a tool allowing the exploration of a complete representation of the ToL (between 800,000 and 2.2 million species depending on the data source) in a zoomable interface. A server version of Lifemap also allows users to visualize their own trees. This should help researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology in their everyday work, but may also permit the diffusion to a broader audience of our current knowledge of the evolutionary relationships linking all organisms.},

We belief, that an ontology visualization equipped with intuitive interactions can simplify this process, and help the user during ontology exploration and development. We introduce an approach representing an ontology with two different tree visualization techniques: the node-link technique, and the containment technique. These two representations show the structure of an ontology differently. The former, represents an ontology as a graph structure. This graph structure, based on the ontology hierarchy and properties, can be explored in different geometries: Euclidean, hyperbolic and spherical. The second representation shows only the hierarchical structure. The design of the containment approach is implemented in a non-standard way. In place of traditional two-dimensional space-filling techniques, we elaborate on the sphere-packing approach and make our hierarchy visualization three-dimensional. We augment this technique with the semantic zoom functionality, where the level of detail is a function of a distance from the viewer.},

  abstract = {Space-filling techniques seek to use as much as possible the visual space to represent a dataset, splitting it into regions that represent the data elements. Amongst those techniques, Treemaps have received wide attention due to its simplicity, reduced visual complexity, and compact use of the available space. Several different Treemap algorithms have been proposed, however the core idea is the same, to divide the visual space into rectangles with areas proportional to some data attribute or weight. Although pleasant layouts can be effectively produced by the existing techniques, most of them do not take into account relationships that might exist between different data elements when partitioning the visual space. This violates the distance-similarity metaphor, that is, close rectangles do not necessarily represent similar data elements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Neighborhood Treemap (Nmap), that seeks to solve this limitation by employing a slice and scale strategy where the visual space is successively bisected on the horizontal or vertical directions and the bisections are scaled until one rectangle is defined per data element. Compared to the current techniques with the same similarity preservation goal, our approach presents the best results while being two to three orders of magnitude faster. The usefulness of Nmap is shown by two applications involving the organization of document collections and the construction of cartograms illustrating its effectiveness on different scenarios.},

  abstract = {Rooted trees abound in computing and it is often necessary to draw them for visualization and documentation purposes. In the classical convention for tree drawing, the tree is drawn in a "level" fashion, with nodes (represented by boxes) at depth k lying on a horizontal line at a distance of k units below the root. The parent-child relationships are represented by lines between the boxes. Several algorithms have been developed for constructing a compact layout of a tree in the classical convention. In this paper we investigate algorithms for drawing trees according to two new conventions. In the inclusion convention, nodes are represented by boxes, and the parent-child relationship is represented by inclusion of one box in another. The tip-over convention again represents nodes as boxes, and, like the classical convention, represents the parent-child relationship by lines between the boxes; however, we allow siblings to be arranged vertically rather than horizontally. For many of the cases which arise in visualization of trees (for example, binary trees with textual information at the leaves) we present polynomial time algorithms. However, the general problem of finding minimum size layouts for either of the new conventions is shown to be NP-hard.},

Traditionally, treemap algorithms have exhibited a trade off between good aspect ratio and ordered layout. The new Split Layout is compared to five published treemap algorithms. Properties such as avarage aspect ratio, stability, run time and readability are measured, and it is shown that the new Split Layout performs better than any known ordered layout. The average aspect ratio is about 23\% better and the stability increased between 28\% and 40\%. A user study was performed to measure the quality of the ordering of the new algorithm. 30 users gave a total of 360 measured response times, and it was found that the median time to locate a specific rectangle in the treemap only took 0.14 seconds (5\%) longer for the Split Layout than for the Pivot by Split Size algorithm. The technique was implemented on a PDA and used for visualizing threaded discussion forums. User studies confirm that the concept on using treemaps on PDAs looks promising.

  abstract = {Researchers and analysts in modern industrial and academic environments are faced with a daunting amount of multi-dimensional data. While there has been significant development in the areas of data mining and knowledge discovery, there is still the need for improved visualizations and generic solutions. The state-of-the-art in visual analytics and exploratory data visualization is to incorporate more profound analysis methods while focusing on fast interactive abilities. The common trend in these scenarios is to either visualize an abstraction of the data set or to better utilize screen-space. This paper presents a novel technique that combines clustering, dimension reduction and multi-dimensional data representation to form a multivariate data visualization that incorporates both detail and overview. This amalgamation counters the individual drawbacks of common projection and multi-dimensional data visualization techniques, namely ambiguity and clutter. A specific clustering criterion is used to decompose a multi-dimensional data set into a hierarchical tree structure. This decomposition is embedded in a novel Dimensional Anchor visualization through the use of a weighted linear dimension reduction technique. The resulting Structural Decomposition Tree (SDT) provides not only an insight of the data set's inherent structure, but also conveys detailed coordinate value information. Further, fast and intuitive interaction techniques are explored in order to guide the user in highlighting, brushing, and filtering of the data.},

  pages = {97--101},
  abstract = {Treemaps are a powerful method to visualize especially time-invariant hierarchical data. Most attention is drawn to rectangular treemaps, because their space-filling layouts provide good scalability with respect to the amount of data that can be displayed. Since circular treemaps sacrifice the space-filling property and since higher level circles only approximately match the aggregated size of their descendants, they are rarely used in practice. However, for drawing circular glyphs their shape preserving property can outweigh these disadvantages and facilitate comparative tasks within and across hierarchy levels. The interactive ClockMap visualization effectively supports the user in exploring and finding patterns in hierarchical time-series data through drill-down, semantic zoom and details-on-demand. In this study, the technique's applicability is demonstrated on a real-world dataset about network traffic of a large computer network and its advantages and disadvantages are discussed in the context of alternative layouts.},

In this paper we investigate the area requirement of planar upward drawings of rooted trees. We give tight upper and lower bounds on the area of various types of drawings, and provide linear-time algorithms for constructing optimal area drawings. Let T be a bounded-degree rooted tree with N nodes. Our results are summarized as follows: We show that T admits a planar polyline upward grid drawing with area O(N), and with width O(N*alpha) for any prespecified constant a such that 0<alpha<1. If T is a binary tree, we show that T admits a planar orthogonal upward grid drawing with area O (N log log N). We show that if T is ordered, it admits an O(N log N)-area planar upward grid drawing that preserves the left-to-right ordering of the children of each node. We show that all of the above area bounds are asymptotically optimal in the worst case. We present O(N)-time algorithms for constructing each of the above types of drawings of T with asymptotically optimal area. We report on the experimentation of our algorithm for constructing planar polyline upward grid drawings, performed on trees with up to 24 million nodes.},

The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we present the ``Weighted Maps'', a novel SDT layout algorithm and discuss the algorithmic differences with the other state-of-the-art SDT algorithms. Second, we present the quantitative results and analyses of a number of metrics that were used to assess the quality of the resulting layouts. The analyses are illustrated with figures generated from various datasets.

New embedding schemes are presented in which (asymptotically) 100 percent of the PE's are utilized as tree nodes. This is a significant savings over known schemes, which achieve 50 percent utilization (the well-known H-tree) and 71 percent for some hexagonal schemes.

  institution = {IBM Research},
  year = {2011},
  number = {RC25132},
  abstract = {Treemaps are a widely used technique for the visualization of hierarchical data. In general, these techniques perform a space-filling recursive subdivision of a 2D space where the sizes of the created regions correspond to values of a particular data attribute. Several subdivision algorithms have been proposed to optimize specific criteria, such as region aspect ratio or stability. However, these goals are often contradictory. For example, existing layout algorithms that optimize for aspect ratio -- important for legibility -- are typically not stable. For this reason, Treemaps are rarely used in animated displays of time-variant data. When they are applied to dynamic data sets, unstable Treemap layout algorithms produce poorly animated transitions that include discontinuous jumps in region position when values change. This paper introduces a new technique called Dynamic Voronoi Treemaps. Our layout algorithm is specifically designed to support smooth, real-time animation of time varying hierarchical data while maintaining desirable aspect ratios. We describe our novel approach and outline how it overcomes key limitations of prior Voronoi-based Treemap work to enable the visualization of dynamic data. Results from an evaluation study of the technique are provided along with a brief use case highlighting a real-world application of Dynamic Voronoi Treemaps.},

Nowadays, structural information is becoming more and more important. Hierarchies, for instance, are frequently applied to make large and complex data manageable. Hence, a visual depiction of hierarchical structures in space and time is required. While there are several techniques addressing specific aspects of spatiotemporal visualization, approaches that cope with space, time, data, and structure are rare. With this paper we take a step to fill this gap. By combining various well-established concepts we achieve a reasonably complete visualization of all of the aforementioned aspects, where our focus is on hierarchical structures. We embed hierarchies directly into regions of a map display using variants of the point-based layout. Layering and animation are applied to visualize temporal aspects. Depending on analysis goals, users can switch between representations that emphasize data attributes or hierarchical structures. Interaction techniques support users in navigating the data and their visualization. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by adapting it to implement a visualization for spatio-temporal human health data.},

  abstract = {Space-restricted techniques for visualizing hierarchies generally achieve high scalability and readability (e.g., tree maps, bundle views, sunburst). However, the visualization layout directly depends on the hierarchy, that is, small changes to the hierarchy can cause wide-ranging changes to the layout. For this reason, it is difficult to use these techniques to compare similar variants of a hierarchy because users are confronted with layouts that do not expose the expected similarity. Voronoi treemaps appear to be promising candidates to overcome this limitation. However, existing Voronoi treemap algorithms do not provide deterministic layouts or assume a fixed hierarchy. In this paper we present an extended layout algorithm for Voronoi treemaps that provides a high degree of layout similiarity for varying hierarchies, such as software-system hierarchies. The implementation uses a deterministic initial-distribution approach that reduces the variation in node positioning even if changes in the underlying hierarchy data occur. Compared to existing layout algorithms, our algorithm achieves lower error rates with respect to node areas in the case of weighted Voronoi diagrams, which we show in a comparative study.},

Futhermore, a layout quality score based on existing treemap layout metrics (e.g., average distance change, relative direction change, average aspect ratio) has been used to evaluate the results of the proposed hybrid layout algorithm and to demonstrate its usefulness applied on representative hierarchical data sets.},

We recursively calculate a set of non-overlapped polygonal nodes that are adjacent in the hierarchical manner. Thus, the display space is fully used for displaying nodes, while the hierarchical relationships among the nodes are presented by the adjacency (or boundary-sharing) of the nodes. It is different from the other traditional connection approaches that use a node-link diagram to present the parent-child relationships which waste the display space. The hierarchy spreads from north-west to south-east in a top-down manner which naturally follows the traditional way of human perception of hierarchies. We discuss the characteristics, advantages and limitations of this new technique and suggestions for future research.},

Major advantages of the RELT approach include: elegance recursive division of the display area, space-filling, maximum usage of screen estate, and clarity of the hierarchical structure. It offers the flexibility such that users can customize the hierarchy's root location and stylize the layout. The RELT drawing algorithm is adaptable and customizable for different application domains. We have implemented the RELT interface on the Google Android emulator. The paper presents the Android implementation, and then provides an analytical and empirical comparison of the Android implementation with a traditional cell phone interface in terms of their performances in navigating hierarchical information.},

We present several adaptions of popular graph drawing approaches to the problem of contour tree drawing and evaluate them. We identify five aesthetic criteria for drawing contour trees and present a novel algorithm for drawing contour trees in the plane that satisfies four of these criteria. Our implementation is fast and effective for contour tree sizes usually used in interactive systems (around 100 branches) and also produces readable pictures for larger trees, as is shown for a $\sim 800$ branch example.},

The extended grid EM(r, s) is the graph whose vertex set is the set of pairs on nonnegative integers, {(i, j) : 0 <= i < r, 0 <= j < s}, in which there is an edge between vertices (i, j) and (k, l) if and only if |I - k| <= 1 and |j - l| <= 1. In this paper, we give an embedding of any complete binary tree of odd height into its optimal square extended grid. This embedding has edge-congestion 1, dilation 2^(n-2) + 1, and its average dilation is less than 1.12. We also show that an embedding of a complete binary tree of odd height into its optimal grid, which is obtained from the embedding into the optimal extended grid by a simple transformation, has edge-congestion 2, dilation 2^(n-1), and it creates in the grid far fewer edges of congestion 2 than the embedding from Zienicke (1990).},

Involv is the result of a year-long iterative development process and includes over 1.2 million named species organized in a nine-level hierarchy.

  abstract = {Very early in the object recognition process the human visual system extracts shading information. While shading can enhance the visibility of structures, it can have a negative impact on the judgment of sizes of elements in a structure. In certain visualization systems the underlying hierarchical structure is not noticeably explicit, such as in space-filling techniques. We hypothesize that in such cases, shading can make the structure more explicit. In this paper, we report the results of two experiments designed to investigate the effects of shading information on extracting the structure in space-filling visualizations. In the first experiment subjects performed better with the visualization tool with shading on structure-based tasks. Our results do not show that shading impairs users' judgment on size-based tasks. A subjective evaluation shows that users preferred interacting with the system when shading was available. The second experiment was designed to investigate further users' capacity to identify structural elements within the space-filling visualization. A substructure recognition task was employed in this experiment and results show that users are capable of identifying sub-structures quicker and with fewer errors when the visualization tool was equipped with shading information than without. The results of both experiments provide evidence that shading information can be used to effectively obtain structural information from space-filling visualizations.},

  abstract = {We see many kinds of large-scale hierarchical data in our daily lives, such as file systems of computers, company organizations, and category-based Web search sites such as Yahoo. Most of the GUIs for these data sources first represent a higher level of the data, and provide an interface so that users can select an interesting portion of the data and locally explore the lower levels. On the other hand, there are not many visualization techniques that give an overview of the data by placing all of the lower-level data onto a display region. How can we implement such a technique that represents all the data in one display, just like the showcases of a jewelry store displays all the jewels in the shop? That is the motivation of this research. The report presents a visualization technique that places all of the lowest-level portions of a hierarchical data set on a display space. It first groups icons that denote the lowest-level data, and then generates rectangles that enclose each group of icons. It repeats the process of generating rectangles that enclose the lower-level rectangles, until the highest-level rectangles are enclosed by the largest rectangle. To use the display space most reasonably, our technique efficiently searches for gaps where rectangles can be located without overlapping adjacent rectangles. We use Delaunay triangular meshes that connect the centers of the rectangles to quickly find the gaps.},

One of the authors has reported a hierarchical data visualization technique, and applied it to various large-scale computing data including large-scale Web sites, but also for data mining results, Web search queries, network intrusion detection results, and distributed processes. This paper presents the new hierarchical data visualization technique, HeiankyoView, which can be also applied to various large-scale computing fields. It places data items of input data while it packs the items as many as possible in small display areas, and aligns the items along X-axis and Y-axis of the display area. The technique represents nodes of hierarchical data as a set of rectangles, which are parallel to X-axis and Y-axis. Here the technique orthogonally divides the display area by extension lines of edges of previously placed rectangles. By referring the grid-like subspaces of the display area, the technique quickly finds the adequate positions to place remaining rectangles.},

  abstract = {We present a technique for the representation of large-scale hierarchical data which aims to provide good overviews of complete structures and the content of the data in one display space. The technique represents the data by using nested rectangles. It first packs icons or thumbnails of the lowest-level data and then generates rectangular borders that enclose the packed data. It repeats the process of generating rectangles that enclose the lower-level rectangles until the highest-level rectangles are packed. We present two rectangle-packing algorithms for placing items of hierarchical data onto display spaces. The algorithms refer to Delaunay triangular meshes connecting the centers of rectangles to find gaps where rectangles can be placed. The first algorithm places rectangles where they do not overlap each other and where the extension of the layout area is minimal. The second algorithm places rectangles by referring to templates describing the ideal positions for nodes of input data. It places rectangles where they do not overlap each other and where the combination of the layout area and the distances between the positions described in the template and the actual positions is minimal. It can smoothly represent time-varying data by referring to templates that describe previous layout results. It is also suitable for semantics-based or design-based data layout by generating templates according to the semantics or design.},

  abstract = {We present a new visualization technique, called RDT (Reconfigurable Disc Tree) which can alleviate the disadvantages of cone trees significantly for large hierarchies while maintaining its context of using 3D depth. In RDT, each node is associated with a disc around which its children are placed. Using discs instead of cones as the basic shape in RDT has several advantages: significant reduction of occluded region, sharp increase in number of displayed nodes, and easy projection onto plane without visual overlapping. We show that RDT can greatly enhance user perception by transforming its shapes dynamically in several ways:(1) disc tree which can significantly reduce the occluded region by the foreground objects, (2) compact disc tree which can increase the number of nodes displayed on the screen, and (3) plane disc tree which can be mapped onto the plane without visual overlapping. We describe an implementation of our visualization system called VISIT (Visual Information System for reconfigurable dIsc Tree). It provides 2D and 3D layouts for RDT and various user interface features such as tree reconfiguration, tree transformation, tree shading, viewing transformation, animation, selection and browsing which can enhance the user perception and navigation capabilities. We also evaluate our system using the following three metrics: percentage of occlusion, density of displayed nodes on a screen. number of identifiable nodes.},

  title = {Drawing Trees: How Many Circles to Use?},
  institution = {University of Illinois},

  abstract = {In this paper, we proposed a new approach for drawing rooted trees on circles. Previous approaches either draw entire tree on a single circle or draw too many circles that every node and its children are on a new circle. As a result, they only work well on limited kinds of trees. In contrary, our approach adaptively choose how many circles to use based on a single user input and it can be generalized well to all kinds of trees. Our approach has three phases. First, we recursively divide the tree into a hierarchy of subtrees according to the user input. The subtrees are then processed from bottom to top of the hierarchy and each of them is drawn around a separated circle. Finally, layout of subtrees are assembled together to form the layout of the entire tree. Comparing to previous methods, our approach obtains both compact and pleasing tree drawings with less bends. Furthermore, our method naturally supports visualization interactions, such as locally zooming in/out, when user navigates the drawings. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

The ERSF technique represents ontology terms as circular regions in 3D. Orbital connections in a third dimension correspond to non-tree edges in the ontology that exist when an ontology term belongs to multiple categories. Biologists can use the ERSF layout to identify highly activated pathway or gene ontology categories by mapping experimental statistics such as coefficient of variation and overrepresentation values onto the visualization.

Currently, visualization tools for large metabolic networks often result in a dense web of connections that is difficult to interpret biologically. The MetNetGE application organizes and visualizes biological networks in a meaningful way to improve performance and biological interpretability. MetNetGE is an interactive visualization tool based on the Google Earth platform. MetNetGE features novel visualization techniques for pathway and ontology information display. Instead of simply showing hundreds of pathways in a complex graph, MetNetGE gives an overview of the network using the hierarchical pathway ontology using a novel layout, called the Enhanced Radial Space-Filling (ERSF) approach that allows the network to be summarized compactly. The non-tree edges in the pathway or gene ontology, which represent pathways or genes that belong to multiple categories, are linked using orbital connections in a third dimension. Biologists can easily identify highly activated pathways or gene ontology categories by mapping of summary experiment statistics such as coefficient of variation and overrepresentation values onto the visualization. After identifying such pathways, biologists can focus on the corresponding region to explore detailed pathway structure and experimental data in an aligned 3D tiered layout. In this paper, the use of MetNetGE is illustrated with pathway diagrams and data from E. coli and Arabidopsis. MetNetGE is a visualization tool that organizes biological networks according to a hierarchical ontology structure. The ERSF technique assigns attributes in 3D space, such as color, height, and transparency, to any ontological structure. For hierarchical data, the novel ERSF layout enables the user to identify pathways or categories that are differentially regulated in particular experiments. MetNetGE also displays complex biological pathway in an aligned 3D tiered layout for exploration.},

  abstract = {Treemaps are a graphically based method for the visualization of hierarchical or categorical data spaces. Treemap presentations of data shift mental workload from the cognitive to the perceptual systems, taking advantage of the human visual processing system to increase the bandwidth of the human-computer interface. Efficient use of display space allows for the simultaneous presentation of thousands of data records, as well as facilitating the presentation of semantic information. Treemaps let users see the forest and the trees by providing local detail in the context of a global overview, providing a visually engaging environment in which to analyze, search, explore and manipulate large hierarchical and categorical data spaces. The treemap method of hierarchical visualization, at its core, is based on the property of containment. This property of containment is a fundamental idea which powerfully encapsulates many of our reasons for constructing information hierarchies. All members of the treemap family of algorithms partition multi-dimensional display spaces based on weighted hierarchical data sets. In addition to generating treemaps and standard traditional hierarchical diagrams, the treemap algorithms extend non-hierarchical techniques such as bar and pie charts into the domain of hierarchical presentation. Treemap algorithms can be used to generate bar charts, outlines, traditional 2-D node and link diagrams, pie charts, cone trees, cam trees, drum trees, etc. Generating existing diagrams via treemap transformations is an excercise meant to show the power, ease, and generality with which alternative presentations can be generated from the basic treemap algorithms. Controlled experiments with novice treemap users and real data highlight the strengths of treemaps and provide direction for improvement. Experimental results show that treemaps are a powerful visualization tool for large data sets, significantly reducing user performance times for global comparison tasks. Effective visualizations of large data sets can help users gain insight into relevant features of the data, construct accurate mental models of the information, and locate regions of particular interest. Treemaps are based on simple, fundamental ideas, but they are the building blocks with which an entire world of unique and exciting visualizations can be built.},

Users can input any tree on the online 3DPE, then rotate, scroll, rescale, and explore it interactively as "live" 3D views. All objects in 3DPE are clickable to display subtrees, connectivity path highlighting, sequence alignments, and gene summary views, and etc. To illustrate the value of this visualization approach for microbial genomes, we also generated 3D phylogeny analyses for all clusters from the public COG database. We constructed tree views using well-established methods and graph algorithms. We used Scientific Python to generate VRML2 3D views viewable in any web browser. 3DPE provides a novel phylogenetic tree projection method into 3D space and its web-based implementation with live 3D features for reconstruction of phylogenetic trees of COG database.},

A naive application of this model leads to unsatisfactory results, hence it is tailored to suit our purposes better. Continuing branches are emphasized, long branches are contracted, and sets of leaves are shown as fruit. The method is applied to the visualization of directory structures. The elements, directories and files, as well as their relations can easily be extracted, thereby showing that the use of methods from botanical modeling can be effective for information visualization.},

  abstract = {A number of points in k dimensions are displayed by associating with each point a symbol: a drawing of a tree or a castle. All symbols have the same structure derived from a hierarchical clustering algorithm applied to the k variables (dimensions) over all points, but their parts are coded according to the coordinates of each individual point. Trees and castles show general size effects, the change of whole clusters of variables from point to point, trends, and outliers. They are especially appropriate for evaluating the clustering of variables and for observing clusters of points. Their major advantage over earlier attempts to represent multivariate observations (such as profiles, stars, faces, boxes, and Andrews's curves) lies in their matching of relationships between variables to relationships between features of the representing symbol. Several examples are given, including one with 48 variables.},

Several variations of Treemap have been developed to represent different types of data. In this paper, we propose an Edge Equalized Treemap, a representation that embeds visual data such as a bar chart in leaf rectangles. This representation is characterized by leaf rectangles of equal widths. Because their widths are equal, the scale intervals of charts in a leaf rectangle can be unified, meaning that we can compare charts simply by looking at them. We compare the Edge Equalized Treemap with existing layout methods, and demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.},

By regarding the information structures used in computers as complex objects, we can abstract these objects as well as control their amount. Using our method, (1) the total amount of information is kept nearly constant even when users change their focuses of attention and (2) this amount can be set flexibly. Through mathematical analysis, we show our method's ability to control the amount. An application to program display is also shown. When this method is applied to the display of structured programs, it provides fisheye-like views which integrate local details around the focal point and major landmarks further away.},

  abstract = {Tree and graph structures have been widely used to present hierarchical and linked data. Hyperbolic trees are special types of graphs composed of nodes (points or vertices) and edges (connecting lines), which are visualized on a non-Euclidean space. In traditional Euclidean space graph visualization, distances between nodes are measured by straight lines. Displays of large graphs in Euclidean spaces may not utilize efficiently the available space and may impose limitations on the number of graph nodes. The special hyperbolic space rendering of tree-graphs enables adaptive and efficient use of the available space and facilitates the display of large hierarchical structures. In this paper we report on a newly developed advanced hyperbolic graph viewer, Hyperbolic Wheel, which enables the navigation, traversal, discovery and interactive manipulation of information stored in large hierarchical structures. Examples of such structures include personnel records, disc directory structures, ontological constructs, web-pages and other nested partitions. The Hyperbolic Wheel framework provides an intuitive and dynamic graphical interface to explore and retrieve information about individual nodes (data objects) and their relationships (data associations). The Hyperbolic Wheel is freely available online for educational and research purposes.},

The layout data indicate a parent position for parent nodes and, for children that share a parent node, child positions approximately along a circle in the layout space with the parent position approximately at the circle's center. Adjacent child positions are separated by approximately a base spacing. The radii of circles within the branch together approximate a function that increases slowly with number of child nodes such that the radii and spacings along circles are all approximately uniform within the branch. The layout data can be obtained from data defining the node-link structure. The layout data can be used to perform mappings, each obtaining positions for a subset of the nodes. The layout data can be used to present a first representation of the node-link structure on a display. In response to a user signal indicating a change from a first display position near a first feature to a second display position, a second representation can be presented that is perceptible as a changed continuation of the first. The second representation includes, near the second display position, a second feature representing the same part of the node-link structure as the first feature.

The last representation in the sequence is perceptible as a changed continuation of the first. Each representation includes bounded node features, each with a center of area and a nearest node spacing that define a mid-spacing circle. All mid-spacing circles together determine an outer convex hull enclosing a total area for the representation. The mid-spacing circles of a subset of more spaced node features determine an inner convex hull enclosing approximately half the total area and enclosing a region in which nearest node spacings are in general perceptibly greater than in another region outside the second convex hull. The node features also represent a peripheral branch with lower level nodes that are not represented by more spaced node features. In the peripheral branch, node features that share a parent have centers of area positioned approximately along an arc with sufficiently similar spacings from the center of area of the parent node feature and from adjacent node features that they are perceptible as a group of related node features. The inner convex hulls of the first and last representations include subsets of node features representing different sets of nodes. The sequence can produce a perception that one node feature's nearest node spacing increases while another's decreases. The representations can be presented by a series of iterations, and can be presented at animation speeds to produce a perception of continuously moving node features.},

Our work is motivated by the fact that in spite of years of research and practice, software development and maintenance are still time and resource consuming, and high-risk activities. The most important reason in our opinion is the complexity of many phenomena related to software, such as its evolution and its reliability. In fact, there is very little theory explaining them. Today, we have a unique opportunity to empirically study these phenomena, thanks to large sets of software data available through open-source programs and open repositories. Automatic analysis techniques, such as statistics and machine learning, are usually limited when studying phenomena with unknown or poorly-understood influence factors. We claim that hybrid techniques that combine automatic analysis with human expertise through visualization are excellent alternatives to them. In this paper, we propose a visualization framework that supports quality analysis of large-scale software systems. We circumvent the problem of size by exploiting perception capabilities of the human visual system.},

Although dozens of visualizations for correlated traits have been developed over the decades, the recent explosive growth in the number of traits and species has created a need for a visualization that can scale to dozens of traits mapped to thousands of species and their evolutionary tree to allow the interactive exploration of complex interactions. In this paper, we introduce Det., called detective, an evolutionary tree visualization that allows biologists to see multiple attributes of leaf nodes. We describe a new tree layout algorithm to represent different branch lengths and several visualization and intereaction techniques to address user requirements.

  title = {Angular Treemaps -- A New Technique for Visualizing and Emphasizing Hierarchical Structures},
  pages = {74--80},
  abstract = {Space-filling visualization techniques have proved their capability in visualizing large hierarchical structured data. However, most existing techniques restrict their partitioning process in vertical and horizontal direction only, which cause problem with identifying hierarchical structures. This paper presents a new space-filling method named Angular Treemaps that relax the constraint of the rectangular subdivision. The approach of Angular Treemaps utilizes divide and conquer paradigm to visualize and emphasize large hierarchical structures within a compact and limited display area with better interpretability. Angular Treemaps generate various layouts to highlight hierarchical sub-structure based on user's preferences or system recommendations. It offers flexibility to be adopted into a wider range of applications, regarding different enclosing shapes. Preliminary usability results suggest user's performance by using this technique is improved in locating and identifying categorized analysis tasks.},

Similar to Treemap techniques, it uses enclosure to divide display space into smaller areas for its sub-hierarchies. The algorithm can partition a polygonal shape or even an arbitrary shape into smaller polygons, rotated rectangles or vertical-horizontal rectangles. The proposed method and implementation algorithms provide an effective interactive visualization tool for partitioning large hierarchical structures within a confined display area with different shapes for real-time applications.

  abstract = {Most existing treemaps achieve the space utilization of a single geometrical area, mostly rectangle. Limiting visualization to rectangles could block the human capability on graph recognition, including orientation, shape and differentiation etc. To relax rectangular constraint, we propose a flexible enclosure approach with three algorithms. It partitions large hierarchical structures within a confined display area with different shapes for real-time applications. Our approach is based on the combination of Divide-and-Conquer method and the treemap paradigm. The partitioning algorithms generate three types of layouts with polygonal, angular and rectangular titling, which are flexible to be used separately or combined. We present technical details including the visualization results in the experiments and in the cases studies with real data sets. We evaluated the visualization based on graph drawing aesthetics and optimization criteria. Our usability study shows that (1) treemaps with layout variability support utilization of human capability in graph perception and (2) treemaps adopted in different shaped containers could have a positive impact on user satisfaction and awareness during visual data exploration.},

Systematic support for detecting and reacting to critical process and product states in order to achieve planned goals is usually missing. One means to institutionalize measurement on the basis of explicit models is the development and establishment of a so-called Software Project Control Center (SPCC) for systematic quality assurance and management support. An SPCC is comparable to a control room, which is a well known term in the mechanical production domain. One crucial task of an SPCC is the systematic visualization of measurement data in order to provide context-, purpose-, and role-oriented information for all stakeholders (e.g., project managers, quality assurance managers, developers) during the execution of a software development project. The article will present an overview of SPCC concepts, a concrete instantiation that supports goal-oriented data visualization, as well as examples and experiences from practical applications.},

Suppose that T is a tree which is a subdivision of $T_h$ and is also isomorphic to a subgraph of M. Motivated by issues in optimal VLSI design, we show that the point expansion ratio $n(T)/n(T_h)=n(T)/(2^(h+1)-1)$ is bounded below by 1.122 for h sufficiently large. That is, we give bounds on how many vertices of degree 2 must be inserted along the edges of $T_h$ in order that the resulting tree can be laid out in the grid. Concerning the constructive end of VLSI design, suppose that T is a tree which is a subdivision of $T_h$ and is also isomorphic to a subgraph of the $n\times n$ grid graph. Define the expansion ratio of such a layout to be $n*n/n(T_h)=n*n/(2^(h+1)-1)$. We show constructively that the minimum possible expansion ratio over all layouts of $T_h$ is bounded above by 1.4656 for sufficiently large h. That is, we give efficient layouts of complete binary trees into square grids, making improvements upon the previous work of others. We also give bounds for the point expansion and expansion problems for layouts of Th into extended grids, i.e. grids with added diagonals.},

  abstract = {The majority of program editors available on the market support the view of a directory-explorer style to display only those code lines of interest. Among them, the fisheye and the fractal views of source code (in which each line has a value reflecting the degree of interest and importance) have received a lot of attention in the literature. In information visualization, drawing trees based on fractal theory also plays an interesting role as the so-called balloon drawing of hierarchical data includes two models: the fractal and the SNS (subtrees with nonuniform sizes) models. It is therefore natural to consider a new source code visualization style based on the SNS model of balloon drawing. A main feature of the SNS view is that the value of each line reflects the number of its descendants when the source code is viewed as a tree structure. Unlike the view of a directory-explorer style, the multiscalable font mode (which was originally utilized in the fractal view of source code) displays all the lines in such a way that each line has the font size proportional to its value. In this paper, we investigate various issues concerning the multiscalable font modes of the fish-eye, the fractal, and the SNS views of source code, in hope of providing guidelines for the programmer to better comprehend the program code in practice.},

  abstract = {Hierarchical structures are present in many different areas of our daily life as well as in sciences. Visualization methods are quite commonly applied to support comprehension of the more complex structures. Nodelinks and treemaps are two widely spread directions of such visualization methods. Visualizations using nodelinks have the advantage of explicitly displaying the hierarchical relations between entities. Visualizations using treemaps, on the other hand, allow for a good global understanding of the present entities and some of their properties. We present a visualization tool for hierarchical structures that combines the advantages of treemaps and nodelinks by naturally incorporating them into a 3D layout. The nodelink is built upon the treemap in a direction orthogonal to the treemap plane. Our visualization tool supports various navigation techniques suitable for different analysis tasks. First, the user interaction allows users to render subtrees of the nodelink transparently. Second, the various levels can be explored separately in an intuitive fashion by sliding its plane through the orthogonal nodelink layout and, thus, moving the treemap to the respective level of the hierarchy. Third, zooming into regions of interest is supported by using a focus+context technique that operates on the combined 3D layout. We demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our system for visual exploration purposes in a case study that uses our system as a file explorer. In this context, we perform a user study that evaluates our approach and allows for a comparison to other existing approaches.},

Meanwhile, based on total number of nodes in each layer, SASA dynamically determines width of this circular ring, following the principle "more nodes wider circular ring and fewer nodes thinner circular ring", and in this way, it can optimize the size of nested ring in Sunburst and improve space utilization rate. Finally, User Locating Efficiency (ULE) and Arc Ratio (AR) is put forward to examine SASA, Experimental results show that this algorithm can indeed optimize sector's arrangement, as well as make space utilization better.},

  pages = {259--266},
  abstract = {Treemaps are an important and commonly-used approach to hierarchy visualization, but an important limitation of treemaps is the difficulty of discerning the structure of a hierarchy. This paper presents cascaded treemaps, a new approach to treemap presentation that is based in cascaded rectangles instead of the traditional nested rectangles. Cascading uses less space to present the same containment relationship, and the space savings enable a depth effect and natural padding between siblings in complex hierarchies. In addition, we discuss two general limitations of existing treemap layout algorithms: disparities between node weight and relative node size that are introduced by layout algorithms ignoring the space dedicated to presenting internal nodes, and a lack of stability when generating views of different levels of treemaps as a part of supporting interactive zooming. We finally present a two-stage layout process that addresses both concerns, computing a stable structure for the treemap and then using that structure to consider the presentation of internal nodes when arranging the treemap. All of this work is presented in the context of two large real-world hierarchies, the Java package hierarchy and the eBay auction hierarchy.},

  abstract = {The present invention provides a method and system for constructing a labeled treemap with balanced layout. A range of possible densities of leaf nodes based on designated weights of the leaf nodes and a designated treemap region is determined. A range of possible densities is then searched for a density that could be fitted on and a labeled treemap that could fit on the density. The labeled treemap is presented on a specified display region. By introducing the concept of density into labeled treemap, the present invention ensures the area of region occupied by each leaf node in the constructed labeled treemap is approximately corresponding to the weight of the node, and avoids the case of invisible leaf node in a treemap.},

Often the limited screen space and the risk of occlusion hinders a meaningful explanation of techniques or datasets by additional visual elements. This paper presents a novel way how views from information visualization can be adapted by the use of the well-known illustrative technique "exploded view", to successfully face the problems described above. The application of exploded views gains screen space for an explanation in a smart way and acts explanatory itself. With our approach of illustrating visual representations, the understanding of complex visualization techniques is eased and new comprehensible views on data are given.},

These conventions relax the requirement that a parent must be exactly placed midway between its children, and instead make this a preference which can be violated if this is required for the layout to fit into the required width. Both drawing conventions give rise to a simple kind of quadratic programming problem. We give an iterative gradient projection algorithm for solving this kind of problem, and also a linear time heuristic algorithm. Our algorithms are practical: a tree with three thousand nodes can be laid out in less than a hundred milliseconds with either algorithm.},

Present algorithms either do not let you draw tree nodes of varying shapes and sizes or they draw such trees in a way that does not produce trees as compact as they could be, which is especially important when diagramming a large system. Also, they cannot reuse layout information when the trees changes, so after every change the layout must be recomputed and the tree redrawn. The main difference between these traditional approaches and the author's approach is that his algorithm is more geometric. Unlike other algorithms, it uses an explicit representation of node and subtree contours, and it stores every contour as a polygon. It has three advantages over traditional algorithms. It allows one to draw trees with nodes of any polygonal shape compactly. The data structure supports insert and delete operations on subtrees. It is simple to implement, yet flexible.},

We can lay out much larger structures than can be handled using traditional techniques for drawing general graphs because we assume a hierarchical nature of the data. We impose a hierarchy on the graph by using domain-specific knowledge to find an appropriate spanning tree. Links which are not part of the spanning tree do not influence the layout but can be selectively drawn by user request. The volume of hyperbolic 3-space increases exponentially, as opposed to the familiar geometric increase of euclidean 3-space. We exploit this exponential amount of room by computing the layout according to the hyperbolic metric. We optimize the cone tree layout algorithm for 3D hyperbolic space by placing children on a hemisphere around the cone mouth instead of on its perimeter. Hyperbolic navigation affords a Focus+Context view of the structure with minimal visual clutter. We have successfully laid out hierarchies of over 20,000 nodes. Our implementation accommodates navigation through graphs too large to be rendered interactively by allowing the user to explicitly prune or expand subtrees.},

  abstract = {Many real-world domains can be represented as large node-link graphs: backbone Internet routers connect with 70,000 other hosts, mid-sized Web servers handle between 20,000 and 200,000 hyperlinked documents, and dictionaries contain millions of words defined in terms of each other. Computational manipulation of such large graphs is common, but previous tools for graph visualization have been limited to datasets of a few thousand nodes. Visual depictions of graphs and networks are external representations that exploit human visual processing to reduce the cognitive load of many tasks that require understanding of global or local structure. We assert that the two key advantages of computer-based systems for information visualization over traditional paper-based visual exposition are interactivity and scalability. We also argue that designing visualization software by taking the characteristics of a target user's task domain into account leads to systems that are more effective and scale to larger datasets than previous work. This thesis contains a detailed analysis of three specialized systems for the interactive exploration of large graphs, relating the intended tasks to the spatial layout and visual encoding choices. We present two novel algorithms for specialized layout and drawing that use quite different visual metaphors. The H3 system for visualizing the hyperlink structures of web sites scales to datasets of over 100,000 nodes by using a carefully chosen spanning tree as the layout backbone, 3D hyperbolic geometry for a Focus+Context view, and provides a fluid interactive experience through guaranteed frame rate drawing. The Constellation system features a highly specialized 2D layout intended to spatially encode domain-specific information for computational linguists checking the plausibility of a large semantic network created from dictionaries. The Planet Multicast system for displaying the tunnel topology of the Internet's multicast backbone provides a literal 3D geographic layout of arcs on a globe to help MBone maintainers find misconfigured long-distance tunnels. Each of these three systems provides a very different view of the graph structure, and we evaluate their efficacy for the intended task. We generalize these findings in our analysis of the importance of interactivity and specialization for graph visualization systems that are effective and scalable.},

We present TreeJuxtaposer, a system designed to support the comparison task for large trees of several hundred thousand nodes. We introduce the idea of "guaranteed visibility", where highlighted areas are treated as landmarks that must remain visually apparent at all times. We propose a new methodology for detailed structural comparison between two trees and provide a new nearly-linear algorithm for computing the best corresponding node from one tree to another. In addition, we present a new rectilinear Focus+Context technique for navigation that is well suited to the dynamic linking of side-by-side views while guaranteeing landmark visibility and constant frame rates. These three contributions result in a system delivering a fluid exploration experience that scales both in the size of the dataset and the number of pixels in the display. We have based the design decisions for our system on the needs of a target audience of biologists who must understand the structural details of many phylogenetic, or evolutionary, trees. Our tool is also useful in many other application domains where tree comparison is needed, ranging from network management to call graph optimization to genealogy.},

  pages = {28--35},
  abstract = {Decision tree induction is certainly among the most applicable learning techniques due to its power and simplicity. However learning decision trees from large datasets, particularly in data mining, is quite different from learning from small or moderately sized datasets. When learning from large datasets, decision tree induction programs often produce very large trees. How to efficiently visualize trees in the learning process, particularly large trees, is still questionable and currently requires efficient tools. The paper presents a visualization tool for interactive learning of large decision trees, that includes a new visualization technique called T2.5D (Trees 2.5 Dimensions). After a brief discussion on requirements for tree visualizers and related work, the paper focuses on presenting developing techniques for two issues: (1) how to visualize efficiently large decision trees; and (2) how to visualize decision trees in the learning process},

  abstract = {This paper describes a new technique called EncCon for visualizing and navigating large hierarchical information. This technique consists of two components: visualization and navigation. Visualization uses a fast enclosure+connection method to calculate the geometrical layout for the display of large hierarchies in a two-dimensional space. Our technique uses a rectangular division algorithm for recursively positioning the graph. This visualization aims to maximize the utilization of display space while retaining a good geometrical layout as well as a clear (explicit) presentation of the hierarchical structure of graphs. This paper also presents an experimental evaluation of EncCon's layout algorithm. Besides the layout algorithm, EncCon uses a new focus+context viewing technique for the navigation of large hierarchies. We use the zooming+layering concept to achieve the focus+context viewing, rather than the traditional enlarge+embedded concept, which is used by most of the available focus+context techniques. Technically, it employs semi-transparency to achieve the display of two layers of information in z-coordination at the same visualization. Both context view and detail view are drawn at two separate layers. These layers are then displayed in an overlapped manner at the same physical screen space.},

Such a partition consists of a hierarchy of convex polygons, each having small aspect ratio, and satisfying specified volume constraints. We apply these partitions to obtain a natural extension of the popular Treemap visualization method. Our proposed algorithm is not constrained in using only rectangles, and can achieve provably better guarantees on the aspect ratio of the constructed polygons.  Under relaxed conditions, we can also construct circular partitions in higher-dimensional spaces. We use these relaxed partitions to obtain improved approximation algorithms for embedding ultrametrics into d-dimensional Euclidean space. In particular, we give a polylog(Delta)-approximation algorithm for embedding n-point ultrametrics into R^d with minimum distortion (Delta denotes the spread of the metric). The previously best-known approximation ratio for this problem was polynomial in n. This is the first algorithm for embedding a non-trivial family of weighted graph metrics into a space of constant dimension that achieves polylogarithmic approximation ratio.},

The grid M(r,s) is the graph whose vertex set is the set of pairs on nonnegative integers, {(i,j): 0<=i<r, 0<=j<s}, in which there is an edge between vertices (i,j) and (k,l) if either |i-k|=1 and j=l or i=k and |j-l|=1.

Depending on the parity of the height of the tree, the expansion of these embeddings is approaching 1.606 or 1.51 for grids, and 1.208 or 1.247 for extended grids.},

  pages = {805--818},
  abstract = {How to visualize datasets hierarchically structured is a basic issue in information visualization. Compared to the common diagrams based on the nodes-links paradigm (e.g. trees), the enclosure-based methods have shown high potential to represent simultaneously the structure of the hierarchy and the weight of nodes. In addition, these methods often support scalability up to sizes where trees become very complicated to understand. Several approaches belong to this class of visualization methods such as treemaps, ellimaps, circular treemaps or Voronoi treemaps. This paper focuses on the specific case of ellimaps in which the nodes are represented by ellipses nested one into each other. A controlled experiment has previously shown that the initial version of the ellimaps was efficient to support the perception of the dataset structure and was reasonably acceptable for the perception of the node weights. However it suffers from a major drawback in terms of display space occupation. We have tackled this issue and the paper proposes a new algorithm to draw ellimaps. It is based on successive distortions and relocations of the ellipses in order to occupy a larger proportion of the display space than the initial algorithm. A Monte-Carlo simulation has been used to evaluate the filling ratio of the display space in this new approach. The results show a significant improvement of this factor.},

  abstract = {An alternative form to multidimensional projections for the visual analysis of data represented in multidimensional spaces is the deployment of similarity trees, such as Neighbor Joining trees. They organize data objects on the visual plane emphasizing their levels of similarity with high capability of detecting and separating groups and subgroups of objects. Besides this similarity-based hierarchical data organization, some of their advantages include the ability to decrease point clutter; high precision; and a consistent view of the data set during focusing, offering a very intuitive way to view the general structure of the data set as well as to drill down to groups and subgroups of interest. Disadvantages of similarity trees based on neighbor joining strategies include their computational cost and the presence of virtual nodes that utilize too much of the visual space. This paper presents a highly improved version of the similarity tree technique. The improvements in the technique are given by two procedures. The first is a strategy that replaces virtual nodes by promoting real leaf nodes to their place, saving large portions of space in the display and maintaining the expressiveness and precision of the technique. The second improvement is an implementation that significantly accelerates the algorithm, impacting its use for larger data sets. We also illustrate the applicability of the technique in visual data mining, showing its advantages to support visual classification of data sets, with special attention to the case of image classification. We demonstrate the capabilities of the tree for analysis and iterative manipulation and employ those capabilities to support evolving to a satisfactory data organization and classification.},

  abstract = {Here we introduce a novel quantitative technique for visualizing hierarchically organized data in a geographic context. In contrast to existing techniques, our visualization emphasizes the hierarchical relationships in the data by depicting them in a standard tree format that takes advantage of many fundamental perceptual properties. Our technique allows users to define a geographic axis and visualize how well a tree correlates with the ordering of geographical locations along this axis. This is accomplished by finding the ordering of leaf nodes, subject to the constraints of the tree topology, which minimizes the number of crossings that occur between lines that connect leaf nodes to their associated geographic locations. In this optimal layout, any crossings that occur between these lines indicate discordance between the topology of the tree and the user defined geographic axis. We have developed a branch-and-bound algorithm that allows optimal leaf orderings to be determined quickly enough to support interactive exploration of different geographic axes even for large multifurcating hierarchies. The quantitative nature of our visualization has allowed us to specify a permutation test for determining if the relationship between a tree topology and a geographic axis is statistically significant. In this paper, the utility of our visualization is demonstrated on biological data sets, but our method is applicable to any hierarchical data where geographic structure may be of interest.},

  abstract = {We have developed (1) a graph visualization system that allows users to explore graphs by viewing them as a succession of spanning trees selected interactively, (2) a radial graph layout algorithm, and (3) an animation algorithm that generates meaningful visualizations and smooth transitions between graphs while minimizing edge crossings during transitions and in static layouts. Our system is similar to the radial layout system of Yee et al. (2001), but differs primarily in that each node is positioned on a coordinate system centered on its own parent rather than on a single coordinate system for all nodes. Our system is thus easy to define recursively and lends itself to parallelization. It also guarantees that layouts have many nice properties, such as: it guarantees certain edges never cross during an animation. We compared the layouts and transitions produced by our algorithms to those produced by Yee et al. Results from several experiments indicate that our system produces fewer edge crossings during transitions between graph drawings, and that the transitions more often involve changes in local scaling rather than structure. These findings suggest the system has promise as an interactive graph exploration tool in a variety of settings.},

  abstract = {We consider two aesthetic criteria for the visualization of rooted trees: inclusion and tip-over. Finding the minimum area layout according to either of these two standards is an NP-hard task, even when we restrict ourselves to binary trees. We provide a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for this problem. This result applies to any tree for tip-over layouts and to bounded degree trees in the case of the inclusion convention. We also prove that such restriction is necessary since, for unbounded degree trees, the inclusion problem is strongly NP-hard. Hence, neither a fully polynomial time approximation scheme nor a pseudopolynomial time algorithm exists, unless P=NP. Our technique, combined with the parallel algorithm by Metaxas et al., also yields an NC fully parallel approximation scheme. This latter result holds for inclusion of binary trees and for the slicing floorplanning problem. Although this problem is in P, it is unknown whether it belongs to NC or not. All the above results also apply to other size functions of the drawing (e.g., the perimeter).},

  abstract = {The well-known ReingoldTilford algorithm produces tidy-layered drawings of trees: drawings where all nodes at the same depth are vertically aligned. However, when nodes have varying heights, layered drawing may use more vertical space than necessary. A non-layered drawing of a tree places children at a fixed distance from the parent, thereby giving a more vertically compact drawing. Moreover, non-layered drawings can also be used to draw trees where the vertical position of each node is given, by adding dummy nodes. In this paper, we present the first linear-time algorithm for producing non-layered drawings. Our algorithm is a modification of the ReingoldTilford algorithm, but the original complexity proof of the ReingoldTilford algorithm uses an invariant that does not hold for the non-layered case. We give an alternative proof of the algorithm and its extension to non-layered drawings. To improve drawings of trees of unbounded degree, extensions to the ReingoldTilford algorithm have been proposed. These extensions also work in the non-layered case, but we show that they then cause a $O(n^2)$ run-time. We then propose a modification to these extensions that restores the $O(n)$ run-time.},

  year = {1994},
  abstract = {A processor presents a sequence of images of a hierarchical structure that is perceived as three-dimensional. The hierarchical structure includes conic substructures that can have vertical or horizontal axes. Each cone has a parent node at its vertex and children nodes along its base, each with a link to the parent node. Each child can in turn be at the vertex of another cone. The cones can be rotated in steps that produce the perception of object constancy for each node. For example, if the user requests that an indicated node be moved to a primary viewing position, each of the cones along the path from the indicated node to the root node is rotated in the direction that most directly moves the indicated node to the primary viewing position. Each node can include a selectable unit for indicating it, and a node can also include a grow tab that can be selected to request presentation of its children nodes and links to them. The user can request that the children nodes of a node be replaced by a grow tab. To reduce the computation necessary for each step of rotation, the position relative to a cone's axis for each of 80 points on the base of a cone is computed for a level of the hierarchy and is then stored in an array for subsequent use in positioning nodes on that level. The base point of each node on a rotating cone can then be changed in a linked node data structure, and its new position can then be obtained by simple arithmetic operations using the axis coordinates and the appropriate data from the array. The base of each array can be a polygon whose vertices are nodes, and the base shape can be presented as a shadow to provide additional information and strengthen the perception of three dimensions. Or, the profiles of the cones can be presented as a shadow.},

Without a way to view megatrees, these wondrous objects, representing the culmination of decades of scientific effort, cannot be fully appreciated. The field really needs a solution to this problem to enable scientists to communicate important evolutionary concepts and data effectively, both to each other and to the general public. In this manuscript, we introduce a new approach that solves the problem. Trees with millions of tips, richly embellished with additional data, can now be easily explored within the web browser of any modern hardware with a zooming user interface similar to that used in Google Maps.},

Unfortunately, the algorithm of [2] is not suitable for practical use. The main problem is that the constant hidden in the "Oh " notation for area is quite large (for binary trees was 3900). In this paper, we have made several improvements to the algorithm, which make it suitable for practical use. We have also conducted an experiment on this newer version of the algorithm for randomly-generated general trees with up to 50,000 nodes. Our experiment shows that it constructs area-efficient drawings in practice, with area at most 19 times the number of nodes.},

It allows the non-root nodes to place their children within a maximum of three quads of the Cartesian plane.

In this paper, we propose some enhancements to the H-Tree Layout pedigree visualization method in order to overcome some of the identified limitations. An implementation of the proposed enhancements and results of a preliminary evaluation are also provided.},

  abstract = {Visualizing large family structures is becoming increasingly important, as more genealogical data becomes available. A space-filling h-tree layout pedigree has been recently proposed to make better use of the available space than traditional representations. In a previous paper we applauded the technique's usage of available space but remarked that it makes generation identification difficult and does not allow navigating to descendants of represented individuals. A set of extensions was proposed to help overcome these limitations and a preliminary evaluation suggested that those extensions enhance the original technique. This paper presents a more thorough evaluation carried out to assess if and how the proposed extensions improve the original h-tree layout pedigree technique. Results suggest that these extensions improve user performance on some tasks, effectively provide new functionality, and generally enhance user experience.},

Prioritization rules ensure that less characteristic, peripheral rings are removed first. All scaffolds in the hierarchy tree are well-defined chemical entities making the classification chemically intuitive. The classification is deterministic, data-set-independent, and scales linearly with the number of compounds included in the data set. The application of the classification is demonstrated on two data sets extracted from the PubChem database, namely, pyruvate kinase binders and a collection of pesticides. The examples shown demonstrate that the classification procedure handles robustly synthetic structures and natural products.},

The survey is completed by an outlook to the so far unexplored regions of the design space by giving a few examples of novel combinations of design parameters.

  abstract = {In response to the large number of existing tree layouts, generic ``meta-layouts'' have recently been proposed. These generic approaches utilize layout design spaces to pinpoint a tree drawing with desired characteristics in the wealth of available drawing options and parameters. While design-space-based generic layouts work well for the confined set of implicit space-filling tree layouts, they have so far eluded their extension to explicit node-link diagrams. In order to produce both, implicit and explicit tree layouts, this paper parts with the descriptive nature of the design spaces and instead takes a generative approach based on operators. As these operators can be combined into operator sequences and be used at different stages of the layout process, a small operator set already suffices to yield a large number of different tree layouts. To this end, we present a generic tree layout pipeline and give examples of suitable layout operators to plug into the pipeline. A prototypical implementation of our pipeline and operators is presented, and it is illustrated with space-filling and node-link examples. Furthermore, the paper presents results from a user study evaluating our generative approach as it is realized by the prototype.},

Several algorithms have been proposed to create more useful displays by controlling the aspect ratios of the rectangles that make up a treemap. While these algorithms do improve visibility of small items in a single layout, they introduce instability over time in the display of dynamically changing data, and fail to preserve an ordering of the underlying data. This paper introduces the ordered treemap, which addresses these two shortcomings. The ordered treemap algorithm ensures that items near each other in the given order will be near each other in the treemap layout. Using experimental evidence from Monte Carlo trials, we show that compared to other layout algorithms ordered treemaps are more stable while maintaining relatively favorable aspect ratios of the constituent rectangles. A second test set uses stock market data.},

The resulting data-dense views summarise and simultaneously present hundreds of space-, time-, and variable-constrained subsets of a large multivariate data set in a structure that facilitates their meaningful comparison and supports visual analysis. Interactive techniques allow localised patterns to be explored and subsets of interest selected and compared with the spatial aggregate. Spatial variation is considered through interactive raster maps and high-resolution local road maps. The techniques are developed in the context of 42.2 million records of vehicular activity in a 98 sqkm area of central London and informally evaluated through a design used in the exploratory visualisation of this data set. The main advantages of our technique are the means to simultaneously display hundreds of summaries of the data and to interactively browse hundreds of variable combinations with ordering and symbolism that are consistent and appropriate for space- and time-based variables. These capabilities are difficult to achieve in the case of spatio-temporal data with categorical attributes using existing geovisualisation methods. We acknowledge limitations in the treemap representation but enhance the cognitive plausibility of this popular layout through our two-dimensional ordering algorithm and interactions. Patterns that are expected (e.g. more traffic in central London), interesting (e.g. the spatial and temporal distribution of particular vehicle types) and anomalous (e.g. low speeds on particular road sections) are detected at various scales and locations using the approach. In many cases, anomalies identify biases that may have implications for future use of the data set for analyses and applications. Ordered treemaps appear to have potential as interactive interfaces for variable selection in spatio-temporal visualisation.},

The visual quality of a treemap is commonly measured via the aspect ratio of the rectangles. If the data changes, then a second important quality criterion is the stability of the treemap: how much does the treemap change as the data changes. We present a novel stable treemapping algorithm that has very high visual quality. Whereas existing treemapping algorithms generally recompute the treemap every time the input changes, our algorithm changes the layout of the treemap using only local modifications. This approach not only gives us direct control over stability, but it also allows us to use a larger set of possible layouts, thus provably resulting in treemaps of higher visual quality compared to existing algorithms. We further prove that we can reach all possible treemap layouts using only our local modifications. Furthermore, we introduce a new measure for stability that better captures the relative positions of rectangles. We finally show via experiments on real-world data that our algorithm outperforms existing treemapping algorithms also in practice on either visual quality and/or stability. Our algorithm scores high on stability regardless of whether we use an existing stability measure or our new measure.},

  abstract = {One of the main tasks in information visualisation research is creating visual tools to facilitate human understanding of large and complex information spaces. Hierarchies, being a good mechanism for organising such information, are ubiquitous. Although much research effort has been spent on finding useful representations for hierarchies, visualising large hierarchies is still a difficult topic. One of the difficulties is how to handle the ever increasing scale of hierarchies. Another is how to enable the user to focus on multiple selections of interest while maintaining context. This paper describes a hierarchy visualisation technique called FlexTree to address these problems. It contains some important features that have not been exploited so far. A profile or contour unique to the hierarchy being visualised can be viewed in a bar chart layout. A normalised view of a common attribute of all nodes can be selected by the user. Multiple foci are consistently accessible within a global context through interaction. Furthermore it can handle a large hierarchy that contains 10,000 nodes in a PC environment. This technique has been applied to visualise computer file system structures and decision trees from data mining results. The results from informal user evaluations against these two applications are also presented. User feedback suggests that FlexTree is suitable for visualising large decision trees.},

  pages = {682--687},
  abstract = {This paper presents LensTree, a novel browsing and navigation tool for large hierarchical information structures. It enhances traditional indented lists by applying focus+context view to its design. LensTree dynamically changes the sizes of nodes to provide a focal area around the mouse pointer while keeping nodes in the peripheral area in smaller sizes as context. This enables it to display a larger hierarchy than traditional indented lists within the same screen area. Therefore scrolling and expanding/collapsing are less often used so that it is more efficient for performing browsing and navigation tasks. An informal user test was conducted and the users showed strong interest to LensTree's visual presentation. It suggested that this technique was worth further exploitation.},

In the conventional node-link tree visualization, the screen quickly becomes overcrowded as users open nodes that have too many child nodes to fit in one screen. To address this problem, we propose two extensions to the conventional node-link tree visualization: a list view with a scrollbar and a multi-column interface. We compared them against the conventional tree visualization interface in a user study. Results show that users are able to browse and understand the tree structure faster with the multi-column interface than the other two interfaces. Overall, they also liked the multi-column better than others.},

  abstract = {Hierarchies, also known as trees, is a good means to manage information. Therefore handling hierarchical data structures becomes an important task in the field of information visualization. Focus+context concept is a well-known strategy to cope with the representation of large collections of data. This concept has been applied to many tools for visualizing large hierarchies, such as Hyperbolic Browser, SpaceTree, DOI Tree, etc. Despite the success of these tools, they could not adequately utilize the display space. We propose a technique named Rectangular Tree Browser for the visualization and navigation of large hierarchies. The technique lays out the tree on an imaginary geometrical plane with the root in the center, and then transforms and maps the plane to a limited rectangle area rather than an ellipse area as Hyperbolic Browser does. Comparing with Hyperbolic Browser, our browser makes better use of the display space. Moreover, because regular user interface components are rectangular, by doing this transformation, the browser is easy to be integrated into a user interface that contains more components. We conducted an informal user test with five users performing navigation and selection tasks. Through observation and interview, we found that our users didn't experience any uncomfortability. We believe that Rectangular Tree Browser has the potential to be a good tool for navigation and visualization of large hierarchies.},

In general, performance trends favored the Sunburst tool with respect to correct task performance, particularly on initial use. Performance with Treemap tended to improve over time and use, suggesting a greater learning cost that was partially recouped over time. Each tool afforded somewhat different search strategies, which also appeared to influence performance. Finally, participants strongly preferred the Sunburst tool, citing better ability to convey structure and hierarchy.},

The main contribution is a new layout approach which explicitly takes the development history of software systems into account.

Second, it makes history directly visible in the city layouts, which allows for supporting novel analysis scenarios. We illustrate such scenarios by presenting several thematic cities maps, each capturing specific development history aspects.},

An empirical study examines the validity and usefulness of the location drift metric, showing that it explains some effects on user performance that distance change does not. Next, we introduce `Hilbert' and `Moore' treemap algorithms, which are designed to achieve high spatial stability.

  abstract = {Online pick'em games, such as the recent NCAA college basketball March Madness tournament, form a large and rapidly growing industry. In these games, players make predictions on a tournament bracket that defines which competitors play each other and how they proceed toward a single champion. Throughout the course of the tournament, players monitor the brackets to track progress and to compare predictions made by multiple players. This is often a complex sense making task. The classic bracket visualization was designed for use on paper and utilizes an incrementally additive system in which the winner of each match-up is rewritten in the next round as the tournament progresses. Unfortunately, this representation requires a significant amount of space and makes it relatively difficult to get a quick overview of the tournament state since competitors take arbitrary paths through the static bracket. In this paper, we present AdaptiviTree, a novel visualization that adaptively deforms the representation of the tree and uses its shape to convey outcome information. AdaptiviTree not only provides a more compact and understandable representation, but also allows overlays that display predictions as well as other statistics. We describe results from a lab study we conducted to explore the efficacy of AdaptiviTree, as well as from a deployment of the system in a recent real-world sports tournament.},

In general, hierarchical information is represented as a tree structure. Treemap hierarchically lays out each node as a bounding box, whose size is the same as the specific weight or attribute value of the node. After the original treemap algorithm called slice-and-dice, some extensions to it have been proposed: squarified treemap, ordered treemap and strip treemap. Furthermore, quantum treemap is a quantization version of these extensions. In this paper, the authors propose a new 3D visualization tool for hierarchical information called treecube that can be taken as a 3D extension of treemap.

Practically sophisticated interfaces are necessary for efficiently browsing 3D multimedia data. In this paper, the authors also propose such interfaces. The authors implemented mainly five interface functionalities for the following operations. (1) "Cutting plane" concept to solve the occlusion problem, i.e., nodes located before the plane are hidden to make it easy to see inside nodes. (2) The control of node frames, i.e., their brightness and thickness, for easily understanding the hierarchical structure of nodes. (3) Standard operations for the translation and the rotation of an eye position, and for the zoom in/out. (4) Particular operations for the extraction of the user focus node and for the backward/forward for browsing such node. The authors also implemented (5) a function to assign color information to any node properties because color is the most important factor of the visual display properties.},

As an example, one could consider the geographic composition of inflation in the European Union, or the revenue by product (sub) categories of a firm in the last month. Analysts wish to interpret the structure of the data not only at a single point in time, but examine the changes in the data categories through time. The analysts may need to consider additional dimensions to composition and time, such as the growth rate or profit rate. To reflect such analytic requirements, we have developed an interactive visualization of multi-dimensional, structured data taking the time dimension into account. The data are displayed in a three dimensional hierarchic circular or column plot. The time dimension of the data is represented by animation. Our system provides interactive tools for the visual data analysis and variable set-up of the data display. For better orientation in the data space, we have enhanced the visualization with smooth transitions between different data selections in case of 3D hierarchic plots. The techniques presented can be applied to various data domains. A user study using European inflation data has shown the usefulness for effective economic analysis.},

  number = {US 6137499},
  year = {2000},
  abstract = {A method, system, and computer program product provides data visualization which optimizes visualization of and navigation through hierarchies. A partial hierarchy is generated and displayed. The partial hierarchy consists of a number levels at least equal to a predetermined depth and less than a total number of levels included in a corresponding complete hierarchy. Parent nodes in the bottom level of the partial hierarchy have segments of connection lines extending toward child nodes not included in the partial hierarchy. A user is permitted to mark selected nodes or locations in a displayed partial hierarchy. Partial hierarchies are generated and stored in a cache or generated on-the-fly. Each partial hierarchy ends at a progressively deeper level. An interpolator interpolates a partial hierarchy layout by interpolating corresponding nodes in two partial hierarchies. A hierarchy manager manages partial hierarchies in response to requests from a viewer to move a camera to camera positions. Partial hierarchies are fetched from the cache or the interpolator. A display then displays display views of fetched partial hierarchies corresponding to the camera positions. During free-form navigation, a hierarchy manager determines and maintain an orientation based on at least one reference object. During zooming, an angular orientation is maintained through successive partial hierarchies. Mapping is also provided between a three-dimensional 3D partial hierarchy and a two-dimensional 2D overview of a complete hierarchy.},

This paper presents a novel rendering technique that enables the image synthesis of geometrical complex 3D-Treemaps in real-time. The fully hardware accelerated approach is based on shape generation using geometry shaders. This approach offers increased rendering performance and low update latency compared to existing techniques and through it enables new real-time interaction techniques to large datasets.},

A calling context tree (CCT) represents the caller-callee relationships of a program. A dynamically collected CCT provides method coverage information.

Trevis, our context tree visualization and analysis framework, allows users to visualize, compare, cluster, and intersect CCTs produced by profilers. We evaluate Trevis in the context of a novel profiling tool called FlyBy. FlyBy runs transparently on an end-user's computer and continuously samples the applications' call stack. When the user perceives the application as sluggish, she presses a "Was Slow!" button to tell FlyBy to file a performance failure report. The report contains the CCT based on the call stack samples FlyBy gathered over the last few seconds before the user pressed the button. We show how Trevis allows us to visualize and classify FlyBy bug reports.},

  abstract = {The emergence of very large hierarchies that result from the increase in available data raises many problems of visualization and navigation. On data sets of such scale, classical graph drawing methods do not take advantage of certain human cognitive skills such as shape recognition. These cognitive skills could make it easier to remember the global structure of the data. In this paper, we propose a method that is based on the use of nested irregular shapes. We name it GosperMap as we rely on the use of a Gosper Curve to generate these shapes. By employing human perception mechanisms that were developed by handling, for example, cartographic maps, this technique facilitates the visualization and navigation of a hierarchy. An algorithm has been designed to preserve region containment according to the hierarchy and to set the leaves' sizes proportionally to a property, in such a way that the size of nonleaf regions corresponds to the sum of their children's sizes. Moreover, the input ordering of the hierarchy's nodes is preserved, i.e., the areas that represent two consecutive children of a node in the hierarchy are adjacent to one another. This property is especially useful because it guarantees some stability in our algorithm. We illustrate our technique by providing visualization examples of the repartition of tax money in the US over time. Furthermore, we validate the use of the GosperMap in a professional documentation context and show the stability and ease of memorization for this type of map.},

  pages = {372--383},
  abstract = {We consider straight-line drawings of trees on a hexagonal grid. The hexagonal grid is an extension of the common grid with inner nodes of degree six. We restrict the number of directions used for the edges from each node to its children from one to five, and to five patterns: straight, Y, psi, X, and full. The psi-drawings generalize hv- or strictly upward drawings to ternary trees. We show that complete ternary trees have a psi-drawing on a square of size and general ternary trees can be drawn within area. Both bounds are optimal. Sub-quadratic bounds are also obtained for X-pattern drawings of complete tetra trees, and for full-pattern drawings of complete penta trees, which are 4-ary and 5-ary trees. These results parallel and complement the ones of Frati for straight-line orthogonal drawings of ternary trees. Moreover, we provide an algorithm for compacted straight-line drawings of penta trees on the hexagonal grid, such that the direction of the edges from a node to its children is given by our patterns and these edges have the same length. However, drawing trees on a hexagonal grid within a prescribed area or with unit length edges is NP-hard.},

  abstract = {As the amount of electronic information explodes, hierarchies to handle this information become huge and complex. Visualizing and interacting with these hierarchies become daunting tasks. The problem is exacerbated if the visualization is to be done on massmarket personal computers, with limited processing power and visual resolution. Many of the current visualization techniques work effectively for hierarchies of 1000 nodes. But as the number of nodes increases toward 5000 nodes, these techniques tend to break down. Hierarchies above 5000 nodes usually require special modifications such as clustering, which can affect visual stability. This paper introduces Cheops, a novel approach to the representation, browsing and exploration of huge, complex information hierarchies such as the Dewey Decimal system, which can contain between 1 million and 1 billion nodes. The Cheops approach maintains context within a huge hierarchy, while simultaneously providing easy access to details. This paper will also present some preliminary results from usability tests performed on an 8 wide by 9 deep classification hierarchy, which if fully populated would contain over 19 million nodes.},

Quantum treemaps are designed for laying out images or other objects of indivisible (quantum) size. They are a variation on existing treemap algorithms in that they guarantee that every generated rectangle will have a width and height that are an integral multiple of an input object size.

  abstract = {Treemaps, a space-filling method for visualizing large hierarchical data sets, are receiving increasing attention. Several algorithms have been previously proposed to create more useful displays by controlling the aspect ratios of the rectangles that make up a treemap. While these algorithms do improve visibility of small items in a single layout, they introduce instability over time in the display of dynamically changing data, fail to preserve order of the underlying data, and create layouts that are difficult to visually search. In addition, continuous treemap algorithms are not suitable for displaying fixed-sized objects within them, such as images.This paper introduces a new "strip" treemap algorithm which addresses these shortcomings, and analyzes other "pivot" algorithms we recently developed showing the trade-offs between them. These ordered treemap algorithms ensure that items near each other in the given order will be near each other in the treemap layout. Using experimental evidence from Monte Carlo trials and from actual stock market data, we show that, compared to other layout algorithms, ordered treemaps are more stable, while maintaining relatively favorable aspect ratios of the constituent rectangles. A user study with 20 participants clarifies the human performance benefits of the new algorithms. Finally, we present quantum treemap algorithms, which modify the layout of the continuous treemap algorithms to generate rectangles that are integral multiples of an input object size. The quantum treemap algorithm has been applied to PhotoMesa, an application that supports browsing of large numbers of images.},

In response, a first display region is output within the primary display window and includes a set of one or more subnodes associated with the selected node. If a first subnode in the first display region is then selected for expansion, a second display region is then output within the first display region, and the second display region in turn includes a set of one or more subnodes of the first subnode. This generation of new "nested" display regions then continues as the user continues to explore deeper into the tree hierarchy. A given subnode display region may have one or more controls, such as a sizing button or one or more scroll bars, to facilitate display of node information within the region, and preferably each expanded node remains associated with its subnode display region using a guideline. If generation and display of a subnode display region requires additional screen space, one or more of the subnodes in the "parent" display region are re-positioned.},

Furthermore, we consider rectilinear partitions, which retain more of the schematized flavor of standard rectangular treemaps. Our rectilinear treemaps have constant aspect ratio, independent of $\depth(\tree)$ or the number and weight of the nodes. The leaves of $\tree$ are represented by rectangles, L-, and S-shapes and internal nodes by orthoconvex polygons. We also consider the important special case that $\depth(\tree)=1$, that is, single-level treemaps. We prove that it is strongly NP-hard to minimize the aspect ratio of a rectangular single-level treemap. On the positive side we show how to construct rectilinear and convex single-level treemaps with constant aspect ratio. Our rectilinear single-level treemaps use only rectangles and L-shapes and have aspect ratio at most $2 + 2 \sqrt{3}/3$.

The popular Treemap algorithm visualizes such a tree as a hierarchical partition of a square into rectangles, where the area of the rectangle corresponding to any node in T is equal to the weight of that node. The aspect ratio of the rectangles in such a rectangular partition necessarily depends on the weights and can become arbitrarily high. We introduce a new hierarchical partition scheme, called a polygonal partition, which uses convex polygons rather than just rectangles. We present two methods for constructing polygonal partitions, both having guarantees on the worst-case aspect ratio of the constructed polygons; in particular, both methods guarantee a bound on the aspect ratio that is independent of the weights of the nodes. We also consider rectangular partitions with slack, where the areas of the rectangles may differ slightly from the weights of the corresponding nodes. We show that this makes it possible to obtain partitions with constant aspect ratio. This result generalizes to hyper-rectangular partitions in $R^d$. We use these partitions with slack for embedding ultrametrics into d-dimensional Euclidean space:  we give a polylog(delta)-approximation algorithm for embedding n-point ultrametrics into $R^d$ with minimum distortion, where delta denotes the spread of the metric. The previously best-known approximation ratio for this problem was polynomial in n. This is the first algorithm for embedding a non-trivial family of weighted-graph metrics into a space of constant dimension that achieves polylogarithmic approximation ratio.},

  abstract = {The xps program dynamically displays the Unix processes as a tree or forest in an X Window, the roots on the left and the leaf processes (those with no children) on the right. The status of each process running, sleeping, stopped, etc., can be indicated by different colors. Different users can appear as different colors too. Process selection can be made per user, all users, or through a regular-expression pattern. In contrast to the terminal-based pstree or tree-widget based programs, the tree display uses diagonal lines, and effort is made to effectively use the full 2-dimensional area of the screen by balancing levels and centering the children of a node between their parent. A goal of the program is to give an idea of what's going on graphically as things may be constantly changing. Therefore the display algorithm tries to keep processes close to their parents to reduce the amount of scrolling to see localized process creation and destruction. Some effort is also given to make sure that the tree layout doesn't get wildly reorganized when there are small or localized changes. This makes it easier for the eye to pick up and recognize the changes over a potentially large display area. We describe here criteria for tree animations such as this one and how the xps layout algorithm works. There are some other miscellaneous features of xps. One can select viewing the processes by a single user, a regular expression for users, by all users, and perhaps show kernel processes. One can click on a process to get more information (via ps or a user-specified program) about that process, send a signal, or set the process priority, assuming you have the permission to do so. Since programs of this ilk can consume a bit of CPU on their own, some effort has been made to turn off the update process when the program is iconified or not visible for some other reason such as being obscured by another window. Some attention has been paid to make algorithm display fairly fast in most situations, although it has to be admitted that this comes sometimes at the expense of a nicer layout.},

For this, the proposed approach uses a neural network which is trained on artificially generated dataset,s containing a total of 15.8 million samples. The resulting model is integrated into an approach called Smart- Layouting. This approach is evaluated on real-world data from 100 publicly available software repositories. Compared to other state-of-the-art treemap algorithms it reaches an overall better result. Additionally, this approach can be customized by an end user's needs. The customization allows for specifying weights for the importance of each layout-quality metric. The results indicate, that the algorithm is able to adapt successfully towards a given set of weights.},

The finer grain mixed pattern is then repeated to obtain an overall tree layout. This approach offers an order of area improvement over the existing single stretch layout mixing approaches, while retaining identical boundary-I/O. This makes the proposed approach an order of magnitude superior to the existing techniques.},

However, most studies have mainly focused on layout algorithms and paid limited attention to the interaction with treemaps.

We propose the notion of zoomable treemaps (ZTMs), an hybridization between treemaps and zoomable user interfaces that facilitates the navigation in large hierarchical data sets. By providing a consistent set of interaction techniques, ZTMs make it possible for users to browse through very large data sets (e.g., 700,000 nodes dispatched amongst 13 levels). These techniques use the structure of the displayed data to guide the interaction and provide a way to improve interactive navigation in treemaps.},

Dendrogramix enables users to do tasks which involve both clusters and individual objects that are impracticable with the classical representation, like: to explain why a particular objects belongs to a particular cluster; to elicit and understand uncommon patterns (e.g., objects that could have been classified in a totally different cluster); etc. Those sensemaking tasks are supported by a consistent set of interaction techniques that facilitates the exploration of large clustering results.},

  abstract = {Bayesian analysis through programs like BEAST (Drummond and Rumbaut, 2007) and MrBayes (Huelsenbeck et al., 2001) provides a powerful method for reconstruction of evolutionary relationships. One of the benefits of Bayesian methods is that well-founded estimates of uncertainty in models can be made available. So, for example, not only the mean time of a most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) is estimated, but also the spread. This distribution over model space is represented by a set of trees, which can be rather large and difficult to interpret. DensiTree is a tool that helps navigating these sets of trees. The main idea behind DensiTree is to draw all trees in the set transparently. As a result, areas where a lot of the trees agree in topology and branch lengths show up as highly colored areas, while areas with little agreement show up as webs. This makes it possible to quickly get an impression of properties of the tree set such as well-supported clades, distribution of tMRCA and areas of topological uncertainty. Thus, DensiTree provides a quick method for qualitative analysis of tree sets.},

Trees are discrete objects and it is generally difficult to get a mental grip on a distributions over trees. Visualisation tools like DensiTree can give good intuition on tree distributions. It works by drawing all trees in the set transparently thus highlighting areas where the tree in the set agrees. In this way, both uncertainty in clade heights and uncertainty in topology can be visualised. In our experience, a vanilla DensiTree can turn out to be misleading in that it shows too much uncertainty due to wrongly ordering taxa or due to unlucky placement of internal nodes. DensiTree is extended to allow visualisation of meta-data associated with branches such as population size and evolutionary rates. Furthermore, geographic locations of taxa can be shown on a map, making it easy to visually check there is some geographic pattern in a phylogeny. Taxa orderings have a large impact on the layout of the tree set, and advances have been made in finding better orderings resulting in significantly more informative visualisations. We also explored various methods for positioning internal nodes, which can improve the quality of the image. Together, these advances make it easier to comprehend distributions over trees.},

In addition to the chapters on types of charts and excerpts from Time Series Charts: A Manual of Design and Construction published by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, there are some quasi-technical chapters on such things as the use of cameras and lantern slides, selection of paper, and methods of reproduction, printing, and binding. A chapter on tabulation is thrown in, apparently for good measure. Illustrations on alternate pairs of facing pages arc in color, and these pages contain also decorative chapter identification (bleed-outs) at the top and bottom. Printing was done by the photo offset process. The verbal language is Basic English. A minor feature of the book is a device whereby the reader may spin the pages rapidly until he reaches the desired chapter. On page 453 is given a detailed description of how the book was made up, including the names and addresses of the companies furnishing materials or services. This book departs from the earlier contribution in several respects. Text material is boiled down almost to the vanishing point, leaving the maximum number of charts to speak for themselves.},

  title = {Visualization of Large-Scale Customer Satisfaction Surveys Using a Parallel Coordinate Tree},
  pages = {197--201},
  abstract = {Satisfaction surveys are an important measurement tool in fields such as market research or human resources management. Serious studies consist of numerous questions and contain answers from large population samples. Aggregation on both sides, the questions asked as well as the answers received, turns the multidimensional problem into a complex system of interleaved hierarchies. Traditional ways of presenting the results are limited to one-dimensional charts and cross-tables. We developed a visualization method called the Parallel Coordinate Tree that combines multidimensional analysis with a tree structure representation. Distortion-oriented focus+context techniques are used to facilitate interaction with the visualization. In this paper we present a design study of a commercial application that we built, using this method to analyze and communicate results from large-scale customer satisfaction surveys.},

  abstract = {Various algorithms have been proposed for the difficult problem of producing aesthetically pleasing drawings of trees, see Reingold and Tilford (1981), Wetherell and Shannon (1979) but implementations only exist as ``special purpose software'', designed for special environments. Therefore, many users resort to the drawing facilites available on most personal computers, but the figures obtained in this way still look ``hand-drawn''; their quality is inferior to the quality of the surrounding text that can be realized by today''s high quality text processing systems. In this paper we present an entirely new solution that integrates a tree drawing algorithm into one of the best text processing systems available. More precisely, we present a TeX macro package TreeTeX that produces a drawing of a tree from a purely logical description. Our approach has three advantages. First, labels for nodes can be handled in a reasonable way. On the one hand, the tree drawing algorithm can compute the widths of the labels and take them into account for the positioning of the nodes; on the other hand, all the textual parts of the document can be treated uniformly. Second, TreeTeX can be trivially ported to any site running TeX. Finally, modularity in the description of a tree and TeX's macro capabilities allow for libraries of subtrees and tree classes. In addition, we have implemented an option that produces drawing which make the structure of the trees more obvious to the human eye, even though they may not be as aesthetically pleasing.},

We study the properties of optimal flow trees and show that they consist of logarithmic spirals and straight lines. Computing optimal flow trees is NP-hard.

For example, the product offers of a department store can be organized into product groups and subgroups to form an information hierarchy. A market basket consisting of the products bought by a customer forms a transaction. Market baskets of one or more customers can be ordered by time into a sequence of transactions. Each item in a transaction is associated with a measure, for example, the amount paid for a product. In this paper we present a novel method for visualizing sequences of these kinds of transactions in information hierarchies. It uses a tree layout to draw the hierarchy and a timeline to represent progression of transactions in the hierarchy. We have developed several interaction techniques that allow the users to explore the data. Smooth animations help them to track the transitions between views. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated by examples from several very different application domains.},

It is inspired by the visual metaphor of indented outlines, omnipresent in graphical file browsers and pretty printing of source code. Inner vertices are represented as vertically arranged lines and leaf groups as horizontally arranged lines. A recursive layout algorithm places parent nodes to the left side of their underlying tree structure and leaves of each subtree grouped to the rightmost position. Edges are represented only implicitly by the vertically and horizontally aligned structure of the plot, leading to a sparse and redundant-free visual representation. We conducted a user study with 30 subjects in that we compared IPTPs and node-link diagrams as a within-subjects variable. The study indicates that working with IPTPs can be learned in less than 10 minutes. Moreover, IPTPs are as effective as node-link diagrams for accuracy and completion time for three typical tasks; participants generally preferred IPTPs. We demonstrate the usefulness of IPTPs by understanding hierarchical features of huge trees such as the NCBI taxonomy with more than 300,000 nodes.},

The spatial proximity of neighboring hierarchically structured elements allows us to easily explore trends, countertrends, periodicity, temporal shifts, or anomalies during the evolution synchronously. Interactive features such as expanding or collapsing of subhierarchies additionally help to detect the aforementioned phenomena on different levels of granularity.

Each displayed plot can be filtered for substructures that are mapped to a larger space and hence, unhide more fine-granular substructures that are hidden in the compressed overview. By representing tree structures side-by-side, the viewer can easily compare them visually and detect similar patterns and also anomalies. In our approach, we follow the information seeking mantra: overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand. More interactive features such as expanding and collapsing of nodes, applying different color codings, or distorting the tree horizontally as well as vertically support a viewer when exploring huge hierarchical data sets.

Furthermore, interactive features such as expanding/collapsing of subhierarchies, horizontal/vertical distortions, zooming in/out, or details-on-demand are integrated to allow the user to inspect the data from different viewpoints. The usefulness of the enriched diagrams is illustrated by applying them to file system data where single software constructs are hierarchically organized.

In any such drawing, the edge lengths may be set independently of the angles, without crossing; we describe multiple strategies for setting these lengths.},

  pages = {74--81},
  abstract = {The paper describes an implementation of a tool for visualizing and interacting with huge information hierarchies, and some preliminary empirical evaluation of the tool's efficacy. Existing systems for visualizing huge hierarchies using cone trees "break down" once the hierarchy to be displayed exceeds roughly 1000 nodes, due to increasing visual clutter. The paper describes a system called fsviz which visualizes arbitrarily large hierarchies while retaining user control. This is accomplished by augmenting cone trees with several graphical and interaction techniques: usage-based filtering, animated zooming, hand-coupled rotation, fish-eye zooming, coalescing of distant nodes, texturing, effective use of colour for depth cueing, and the applications of dynamic queries. The fsviz system also improves upon earlier cone tree visualization systems through a more elaborate node layout algorithm. This algorithm enhances the usefulness of cone tree visualization for large hierarchies by all but eliminating clutter.},

This new visualization exploits its adaptive nature to address issues like cluttered display, imperceptible hierarchy, lack of smooth zoom-in and out technique which are common in tree visualization. We also present an algorithm which utilizes the flexibility of our proposed technique to deal with occlusion, a problem inherent in any 3D information visualization. On one hand, our work establishes adaptive visualization as a means of displaying tree-structured data in 3D. On the other, it promotes the technique as a potential candidate for being employed to visualize other information structures also.},

  abstract = {Treemap, a common information visualization approach for dividing a display area into nested rectangles, has a good performance on visualizing hierarchical data. And it enables user to compare nodes in the same level and to learn certain relationship between adjacent levels. However, treemap layout is limited to visualize multi-dimensional hierarchical data in which the hierarchy is unfixed and complex, especially when the hierarchy is an arbitrary graph. Considering this problem, we present a novel extension called magic treemap cube, which improves the layout and has a good performance on visualizing unfixed (cross-level) and complex data, inverting hierarchy without reorganizing the structure, and enabling users to easily compare among treemaps. The magic treemap cube is a three-dimensional regular hexahedron whose six faces are covered by six different treemaps. Each dimension of the magic treemap cube is a hierarchy structure specified by users according to a hierarchical division of visualization information. With the treemap algorithm, tagcloud and mapping rules, the treemaps are automatically controlled by permutations of three dimensions of the cube. Users could observe the six correlative treemaps respectively by rotating the magic treemap cube in three dimensional Cartesian coordinate. And this magic treemap cube can be unfolded into a tiled treemap in 2D Cartesian coordinate for users-friendly comparison of each treemap. Meanwhile, a merging operation to the tiled treemap is proposed to not only compare two treemaps through the adjacency relations among faces but also provide more information. For demonstrating the above characteristics, an application (called OlympicVis) has been implemented to visualize the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games information, which involves multi-dimensional hierarchy and interconnected data. The OlympicVis can display Cube View, Schedule View, Medal View, Date Filter and Time Line.},

SONHC arranged the leaf nodes in sunburst in order using hierarchical clustering algorithm, put the associated dataset as a node in center of the sunburst, and connected it with the associated leaf nodes in sunburst using colored lines. So, it can present not only two hierarchical structures but also the relationships between them. Based on SONHC and some interaction techniques (clicking, contraction and expansion, etc) we developed an associated visual analyzing system (AVAS) for pesticide residues detection results data, which can help users to inspect the hierarchical structure of pesticide and agricultural products and to explore the associations between pesticides and agricultural products, and associations between different pesticides. The results of user experience test showed that SONHC algorithm overperforms than SA and SR algorithm in ULE and ULEs variance. AVAS system is effective in helping users to analyze the pesticide residues data. Furthermore, SONHC algorithm can also be adopted to analyze associated hierarchical data in other fields, such as finance, insurance and e-commerce.},

We prove that, for any complete binary tree t of height h SQRT((n+1)/2)+3.5 if h is odd, (b) 2.5n3.25SQRT(n+1)+3.5 otherwise. As far as we know, this is one of the few examples in which a closed formula for the minimum-area drawing of a graph has been explicitly found. Furthermore this minimum-area h-v drawing can be constructed in linear time.

  abstract = {The task of building effective representations to visualize and explore collections with moderate to large number of documents is hard. It depends on the evaluation of some distance measure among texts and also on the representation of such relationships in bi- dimensional spaces. In this paper we introduce an alternative approach for building visual maps of documents based on their content similarity, through reconstruction of phylogenetic trees. The tree is capable of representing relationships that allows the user to quickly recover information detected by the similarity metric. For a variety of text collections of different natures we show that we can achieve improved exploration capability and more clear visualization of relationships amongst documents.},

Only a single click is needed to reach every node and perform an action on it, such as displaying a web page. The CCT browsing technique was developed for interaction with web hierarchies but is not limited to this domain. We also present sample implementations of CCT using VRML, which show the usefulness of this intuitive tree navigation technique.},

To support the finding, the entire hierarchy is visualized using a squarified treemap. Once an item from the treemap is selected, CoMem supports the understanding of that item by identifying related items in the hierarchy and visualizing the selected item in the context of these related items in a node-link diagram. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of a usability evaluation of CoMem that supports the claim that finding and understanding improve the process of reuse, and that the described visualizations assist with finding and understanding.},

By combining methods used in modern cartography, such as OpenStreetMap, with a new way of representing tree-like structures, I created Lifemap, a tool allowing the exploration of a complete representation of the ToL (between 800,000 and 2.2 million species depending on the data source) in a zoomable interface. A server version of Lifemap also allows users to visualize their own trees. This should help researchers in ecology and evolutionary biology in their everyday work, but may also permit the diffusion to a broader audience of our current knowledge of the evolutionary relationships linking all organisms.},

These two representations show the structure of an ontology differently. The former, represents an ontology as a graph structure. This graph structure, based on the ontology hierarchy and properties, can be explored in different geometries: Euclidean, hyperbolic and spherical. The second representation shows only the hierarchical structure. The design of the containment approach is implemented in a non-standard way. In place of traditional two-dimensional space-filling techniques, we elaborate on the sphere-packing approach and make our hierarchy visualization three-dimensional. We augment this technique with the semantic zoom functionality, where the level of detail is a function of a distance from the viewer.},

  abstract = {Space-filling techniques seek to use as much as possible the visual space to represent a dataset, splitting it into regions that represent the data elements. Amongst those techniques, Treemaps have received wide attention due to its simplicity, reduced visual complexity, and compact use of the available space. Several different Treemap algorithms have been proposed, however the core idea is the same, to divide the visual space into rectangles with areas proportional to some data attribute or weight. Although pleasant layouts can be effectively produced by the existing techniques, most of them do not take into account relationships that might exist between different data elements when partitioning the visual space. This violates the distance-similarity metaphor, that is, close rectangles do not necessarily represent similar data elements. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Neighborhood Treemap (Nmap), that seeks to solve this limitation by employing a slice and scale strategy where the visual space is successively bisected on the horizontal or vertical directions and the bisections are scaled until one rectangle is defined per data element. Compared to the current techniques with the same similarity preservation goal, our approach presents the best results while being two to three orders of magnitude faster. The usefulness of Nmap is shown by two applications involving the organization of document collections and the construction of cartograms illustrating its effectiveness on different scenarios.},

In the classical convention for tree drawing, the tree is drawn in a "level" fashion, with nodes (represented by boxes) at depth k lying on a horizontal line at a distance of k units below the root. The parent-child relationships are represented by lines between the boxes. Several algorithms have been developed for constructing a compact layout of a tree in the classical convention. In this paper we investigate algorithms for drawing trees according to two new conventions. In the inclusion convention, nodes are represented by boxes, and the parent-child relationship is represented by inclusion of one box in another. The tip-over convention again represents nodes as boxes, and, like the classical convention, represents the parent-child relationship by lines between the boxes; however, we allow siblings to be arranged vertically rather than horizontally. For many of the cases which arise in visualization of trees (for example, binary trees with textual information at the leaves) we present polynomial time algorithms. However, the general problem of finding minimum size layouts for either of the new conventions is shown to be NP-hard.},

Traditionally, treemap algorithms have exhibited a trade off between good aspect ratio and ordered layout. The new Split Layout is compared to five published treemap algorithms. Properties such as avarage aspect ratio, stability, run time and readability are measured, and it is shown that the new Split Layout performs better than any known ordered layout. The average aspect ratio is about 23\% better and the stability increased between 28\% and 40\%. A user study was performed to measure the quality of the ordering of the new algorithm. 30 users gave a total of 360 measured response times, and it was found that the median time to locate a specific rectangle in the treemap only took 0.14 seconds (5\%) longer for the Split Layout than for the Pivot by Split Size algorithm. The technique was implemented on a PDA and used for visualizing threaded discussion forums. User studies confirm that the concept on using treemaps on PDAs looks promising.

This paper presents a novel technique that combines clustering, dimension reduction and multi-dimensional data representation to form a multivariate data visualization that incorporates both detail and overview. This amalgamation counters the individual drawbacks of common projection and multi-dimensional data visualization techniques, namely ambiguity and clutter. A specific clustering criterion is used to decompose a multi-dimensional data set into a hierarchical tree structure. This decomposition is embedded in a novel Dimensional Anchor visualization through the use of a weighted linear dimension reduction technique. The resulting Structural Decomposition Tree (SDT) provides not only an insight of the data set's inherent structure, but also conveys detailed coordinate value information. Further, fast and intuitive interaction techniques are explored in order to guide the user in highlighting, brushing, and filtering of the data.},

However, with really large hierarchies, layouts tend to become overcrowded, making it difficult to see details about specific nodes. In contrast, ShamsehTrees focus on layouts centered on a node of interest, provide interactive nested layouts that were inspired by artistic and natural floral patterns, and make use of the natural symmetries in phyllotactic patterns. Instead of emphasizing overall tree structure, these layouts are created to make the most space available for the node of interest. The basic layout is comprised of nested circles that are centered on the node of interest. After selecting a new node of interest, the resizing and repositioning of nodes is animated as they transition to the new layout.},

Most attention is drawn to rectangular treemaps, because their space-filling layouts provide good scalability with respect to the amount of data that can be displayed. Since circular treemaps sacrifice the space-filling property and since higher level circles only approximately match the aggregated size of their descendants, they are rarely used in practice. However, for drawing circular glyphs their shape preserving property can outweigh these disadvantages and facilitate comparative tasks within and across hierarchy levels. The interactive ClockMap visualization effectively supports the user in exploring and finding patterns in hierarchical time-series data through drill-down, semantic zoom and details-on-demand. In this study, the technique's applicability is demonstrated on a real-world dataset about network traffic of a large computer network and its advantages and disadvantages are discussed in the context of alternative layouts.},

In this paper we investigate the area requirement of planar upward drawings of rooted trees. We give tight upper and lower bounds on the area of various types of drawings, and provide linear-time algorithms for constructing optimal area drawings. Let T be a bounded-degree rooted tree with N nodes. Our results are summarized as follows: We show that T admits a planar polyline upward grid drawing with area O(N), and with width O(N*alpha) for any prespecified constant a such that 0<alpha<1. If T is a binary tree, we show that T admits a planar orthogonal upward grid drawing with area O (N log log N). We show that if T is ordered, it admits an O(N log N)-area planar upward grid drawing that preserves the left-to-right ordering of the children of each node. We show that all of the above area bounds are asymptotically optimal in the worst case. We present O(N)-time algorithms for constructing each of the above types of drawings of T with asymptotically optimal area. We report on the experimentation of our algorithm for constructing planar polyline upward grid drawings, performed on trees with up to 24 million nodes.},

  institution = {IBM Research},
  year = {2011},
  number = {RC25132},
  abstract = {Treemaps are a widely used technique for the visualization of hierarchical data. In general, these techniques perform a space-filling recursive subdivision of a 2D space where the sizes of the created regions correspond to values of a particular data attribute. Several subdivision algorithms have been proposed to optimize specific criteria, such as region aspect ratio or stability. However, these goals are often contradictory. For example, existing layout algorithms that optimize for aspect ratio -- important for legibility -- are typically not stable. For this reason, Treemaps are rarely used in animated displays of time-variant data. When they are applied to dynamic data sets, unstable Treemap layout algorithms produce poorly animated transitions that include discontinuous jumps in region position when values change. This paper introduces a new technique called Dynamic Voronoi Treemaps. Our layout algorithm is specifically designed to support smooth, real-time animation of time varying hierarchical data while maintaining desirable aspect ratios. We describe our novel approach and outline how it overcomes key limitations of prior Voronoi-based Treemap work to enable the visualization of dynamic data. Results from an evaluation study of the technique are provided along with a brief use case highlighting a real-world application of Dynamic Voronoi Treemaps.},

Nowadays, structural information is becoming more and more important. Hierarchies, for instance, are frequently applied to make large and complex data manageable. Hence, a visual depiction of hierarchical structures in space and time is required. While there are several techniques addressing specific aspects of spatiotemporal visualization, approaches that cope with space, time, data, and structure are rare. With this paper we take a step to fill this gap. By combining various well-established concepts we achieve a reasonably complete visualization of all of the aforementioned aspects, where our focus is on hierarchical structures. We embed hierarchies directly into regions of a map display using variants of the point-based layout. Layering and animation are applied to visualize temporal aspects. Depending on analysis goals, users can switch between representations that emphasize data attributes or hierarchical structures. Interaction techniques support users in navigating the data and their visualization. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by adapting it to implement a visualization for spatio-temporal human health data.},

  pages = {50--58},
  abstract = {Space-restricted techniques for visualizing hierarchies generally achieve high scalability and readability (e.g., tree maps, bundle views, sunburst). However, the visualization layout directly depends on the hierarchy, that is, small changes to the hierarchy can cause wide-ranging changes to the layout. For this reason, it is difficult to use these techniques to compare similar variants of a hierarchy because users are confronted with layouts that do not expose the expected similarity. Voronoi treemaps appear to be promising candidates to overcome this limitation. However, existing Voronoi treemap algorithms do not provide deterministic layouts or assume a fixed hierarchy. In this paper we present an extended layout algorithm for Voronoi treemaps that provides a high degree of layout similiarity for varying hierarchies, such as software-system hierarchies. The implementation uses a deterministic initial-distribution approach that reduces the variation in node positioning even if changes in the underlying hierarchy data occur. Compared to existing layout algorithms, our algorithm achieves lower error rates with respect to node areas in the case of weighted Voronoi diagrams, which we show in a comparative study.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an approach for hybrid treemaps, which applies and combines several different layout principles within a single tree map in contrast to traditional treemap variants based on a single layout concept. To this end, we analyze shortcomings of state-of-the-art treemap algorithms such as Moore, Voronoi and Strip layouts. Based on a number of identified edge cases, we propose a combination of these different layout algorithms, individually selected for and applied on each sub hierarchy of the given treemap data. The selection decision is based on the number of items to be layouted as well as the aspect ratio of the containing visual elements. Futhermore, a layout quality score based on existing treemap layout metrics (e.g., average distance change, relative direction change, average aspect ratio) has been used to evaluate the results of the proposed hybrid layout algorithm and to demonstrate its usefulness applied on representative hierarchical data sets.},

This paper presents a method called "Radial Edgeless Tree" (RELT) for visualizing trees in a 2-dimensional space. It combines the existing connection tree drawing with the space-filling approach to achieve the efficient display of trees in a small geometrical area, such as the screen that are commonly used in mobile devices. We recursively calculate a set of non-overlapped polygonal nodes that are adjacent in the hierarchical manner. Thus, the display space is fully used for displaying nodes, while the hierarchical relationships among the nodes are presented by the adjacency (or boundary-sharing) of the nodes. It is different from the other traditional connection approaches that use a node-link diagram to present the parent-child relationships which waste the display space. The hierarchy spreads from north-west to south-east in a top-down manner which naturally follows the traditional way of human perception of hierarchies. We discuss the characteristics, advantages and limitations of this new technique and suggestions for future research.},

To display hierarchical information, researchers have proposed many algorithms for desktop screen visualization. Such algorithms are generally divided into connection and enclosure. Connection approach displays hierarchy with a clear structure but consume display area. Enclosure can maximally utilize the screen space but the layout is essentially implicit. This paper describes a new Radial Edgeless Tree (RELT) for visualizing hierarchical data on palm sized devices. The aim of RELT is to combine the advantages of connection and enclosure approaches. By recursively partitioning the display area, this technique maximizes the space usage. The structural clarity of layout can be reached by arranging location of non-overlapping regions.

Our implementation is fast and effective for contour tree sizes usually used in interactive systems (around 100 branches) and also produces readable pictures for larger trees, as is shown for a $\sim 800$ branch example.},

In today's growing complexity of business data with multi dimensional attributes using bar chart itself is not sufficient to deal with the representation of such business dataset and it also not utilizes the screen space efficiently.Nevertheless, bar chart is still useful because of its shape create strong visual attention to users at first glance than other visualization techniques. In this article, we present a treemap bar chart + tablelens interaction technique that combines the treemap and bar chart visualizations with a tablelens based zooming technique that allows users to view the detail of a particular bar when the density of bars increases. In our approach, the capability of the original bar chart and treemaps for representing complex business data is enhanced and the utilization of display space is also optimized.},

  abstract = {Very early in the object recognition process the human visual system extracts shading information. While shading can enhance the visibility of structures, it can have a negative impact on the judgment of sizes of elements in a structure. In certain visualization systems the underlying hierarchical structure is not noticeably explicit, such as in space-filling techniques. We hypothesize that in such cases, shading can make the structure more explicit. In this paper, we report the results of two experiments designed to investigate the effects of shading information on extracting the structure in space-filling visualizations. In the first experiment subjects performed better with the visualization tool with shading on structure-based tasks. Our results do not show that shading impairs users' judgment on size-based tasks. A subjective evaluation shows that users preferred interacting with the system when shading was available. The second experiment was designed to investigate further users' capacity to identify structural elements within the space-filling visualization. A substructure recognition task was employed in this experiment and results show that users are capable of identifying sub-structures quicker and with fewer errors when the visualization tool was equipped with shading information than without. The results of both experiments provide evidence that shading information can be used to effectively obtain structural information from space-filling visualizations.},

  abstract = {We see many kinds of large-scale hierarchical data in our daily lives, such as file systems of computers, company organizations, and category-based Web search sites such as Yahoo. Most of the GUIs for these data sources first represent a higher level of the data, and provide an interface so that users can select an interesting portion of the data and locally explore the lower levels. On the other hand, there are not many visualization techniques that give an overview of the data by placing all of the lower-level data onto a display region. How can we implement such a technique that represents all the data in one display, just like the showcases of a jewelry store displays all the jewels in the shop? That is the motivation of this research. The report presents a visualization technique that places all of the lowest-level portions of a hierarchical data set on a display space. It first groups icons that denote the lowest-level data, and then generates rectangles that enclose each group of icons. It repeats the process of generating rectangles that enclose the lower-level rectangles, until the highest-level rectangles are enclosed by the largest rectangle. To use the display space most reasonably, our technique efficiently searches for gaps where rectangles can be located without overlapping adjacent rectangles. We use Delaunay triangular meshes that connect the centers of the rectangles to quickly find the gaps.},

We present two rectangle-packing algorithms for placing items of hierarchical data onto display spaces. The algorithms refer to Delaunay triangular meshes connecting the centers of rectangles to find gaps where rectangles can be placed. The first algorithm places rectangles where they do not overlap each other and where the extension of the layout area is minimal. The second algorithm places rectangles by referring to templates describing the ideal positions for nodes of input data. It places rectangles where they do not overlap each other and where the combination of the layout area and the distances between the positions described in the template and the actual positions is minimal. It can smoothly represent time-varying data by referring to templates that describe previous layout results. It is also suitable for semantics-based or design-based data layout by generating templates according to the semantics or design.},

  abstract = {We present a new visualization technique, called RDT (Reconfigurable Disc Tree) which can alleviate the disadvantages of cone trees significantly for large hierarchies while maintaining its context of using 3D depth. In RDT, each node is associated with a disc around which its children are placed. Using discs instead of cones as the basic shape in RDT has several advantages: significant reduction of occluded region, sharp increase in number of displayed nodes, and easy projection onto plane without visual overlapping. We show that RDT can greatly enhance user perception by transforming its shapes dynamically in several ways:(1) disc tree which can significantly reduce the occluded region by the foreground objects, (2) compact disc tree which can increase the number of nodes displayed on the screen, and (3) plane disc tree which can be mapped onto the plane without visual overlapping. We describe an implementation of our visualization system called VISIT (Visual Information System for reconfigurable dIsc Tree). It provides 2D and 3D layouts for RDT and various user interface features such as tree reconfiguration, tree transformation, tree shading, viewing transformation, animation, selection and browsing which can enhance the user perception and navigation capabilities. We also evaluate our system using the following three metrics: percentage of occlusion, density of displayed nodes on a screen. number of identifiable nodes.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we proposed a new approach for drawing rooted trees on circles. Previous approaches either draw entire tree on a single circle or draw too many circles that every node and its children are on a new circle. As a result, they only work well on limited kinds of trees. In contrary, our approach adaptively choose how many circles to use based on a single user input and it can be generalized well to all kinds of trees. Our approach has three phases. First, we recursively divide the tree into a hierarchy of subtrees according to the user input. The subtrees are then processed from bottom to top of the hierarchy and each of them is drawn around a separated circle. Finally, layout of subtrees are assembled together to form the layout of the entire tree. Comparing to previous methods, our approach obtains both compact and pleasing tree drawings with less bends. Furthermore, our method naturally supports visualization interactions, such as locally zooming in/out, when user navigates the drawings. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

The ERSF technique represents ontology terms as circular regions in 3D. Orbital connections in a third dimension correspond to non-tree edges in the ontology that exist when an ontology term belongs to multiple categories. Biologists can use the ERSF layout to identify highly activated pathway or gene ontology categories by mapping experimental statistics such as coefficient of variation and overrepresentation values onto the visualization.

Currently, visualization tools for large metabolic networks often result in a dense web of connections that is difficult to interpret biologically.

MetNetGE is an interactive visualization tool based on the Google Earth platform. MetNetGE features novel visualization techniques for pathway and ontology information display. Instead of simply showing hundreds of pathways in a complex graph, MetNetGE gives an overview of the network using the hierarchical pathway ontology using a novel layout, called the Enhanced Radial Space-Filling (ERSF) approach that allows the network to be summarized compactly. The non-tree edges in the pathway or gene ontology, which represent pathways or genes that belong to multiple categories, are linked using orbital connections in a third dimension. Biologists can easily identify highly activated pathways or gene ontology categories by mapping of summary experiment statistics such as coefficient of variation and overrepresentation values onto the visualization. After identifying such pathways, biologists can focus on the corresponding region to explore detailed pathway structure and experimental data in an aligned 3D tiered layout. In this paper, the use of MetNetGE is illustrated with pathway diagrams and data from E. coli and Arabidopsis. MetNetGE is a visualization tool that organizes biological networks according to a hierarchical ontology structure. The ERSF technique assigns attributes in 3D space, such as color, height, and transparency, to any ontological structure. For hierarchical data, the novel ERSF layout enables the user to identify pathways or categories that are differentially regulated in particular experiments. MetNetGE also displays complex biological pathway in an aligned 3D tiered layout for exploration.},

  abstract = {Treemaps are a graphically based method for the visualization of hierarchical or categorical data spaces. Treemap presentations of data shift mental workload from the cognitive to the perceptual systems, taking advantage of the human visual processing system to increase the bandwidth of the human-computer interface. Efficient use of display space allows for the simultaneous presentation of thousands of data records, as well as facilitating the presentation of semantic information. Treemaps let users see the forest and the trees by providing local detail in the context of a global overview, providing a visually engaging environment in which to analyze, search, explore and manipulate large hierarchical and categorical data spaces. The treemap method of hierarchical visualization, at its core, is based on the property of containment. This property of containment is a fundamental idea which powerfully encapsulates many of our reasons for constructing information hierarchies. All members of the treemap family of algorithms partition multi-dimensional display spaces based on weighted hierarchical data sets. In addition to generating treemaps and standard traditional hierarchical diagrams, the treemap algorithms extend non-hierarchical techniques such as bar and pie charts into the domain of hierarchical presentation. Treemap algorithms can be used to generate bar charts, outlines, traditional 2-D node and link diagrams, pie charts, cone trees, cam trees, drum trees, etc. Generating existing diagrams via treemap transformations is an excercise meant to show the power, ease, and generality with which alternative presentations can be generated from the basic treemap algorithms. Controlled experiments with novice treemap users and real data highlight the strengths of treemaps and provide direction for improvement. Experimental results show that treemaps are a powerful visualization tool for large data sets, significantly reducing user performance times for global comparison tasks. Effective visualizations of large data sets can help users gain insight into relevant features of the data, construct accurate mental models of the information, and locate regions of particular interest. Treemaps are based on simple, fundamental ideas, but they are the building blocks with which an entire world of unique and exciting visualizations can be built.},

Our approach serves for better exploitation of human perception capabilities. To achieve this we employ effective visual cues like node position and size. We determine node positions in terms of perceptual organization. Further we determine node sizes for providing redundant hierarchical information. Redundancy aides in better understanding the tree structure. Finally, we point out some of the advantages of this approach to other spatial metaphors such as cone trees.},

Increases in sequence data and complexity are creating a need for more powerful and insightful tree visualization tools. We have developed 3D Phylogeny Explorer (3DPE), a novel phylogeny tree viewer that maps trees onto three spatial axes (species on the X-axis; paralogs on Z; evolutionary distance on Y), enabling one to distinguish at a glance evolutionary features such as speciation; gene duplication and paralog evolution; lateral gene transfer; and violation of the "molecular clock" assumption. Users can input any tree on the online 3DPE, then rotate, scroll, rescale, and explore it interactively as "live" 3D views. All objects in 3DPE are clickable to display subtrees, connectivity path highlighting, sequence alignments, and gene summary views, and etc. To illustrate the value of this visualization approach for microbial genomes, we also generated 3D phylogeny analyses for all clusters from the public COG database. We constructed tree views using well-established methods and graph algorithms. We used Scientific Python to generate VRML2 3D views viewable in any web browser. 3DPE provides a novel phylogenetic tree projection method into 3D space and its web-based implementation with live 3D features for reconstruction of phylogenetic trees of COG database.},

The method is based on the observation that we can easily see the branches, leaves, and their arrangement in a botanical tree, despite of the large number of elements. The strand model of Holton is used to convert an abstract tree into a geometric model. Nonleaf nodes are mapped to branches and child nodes to subbranches. A naive application of this model leads to unsatisfactory results, hence it is tailored to suit our purposes better. Continuing branches are emphasized, long branches are contracted, and sets of leaves are shown as fruit. The method is applied to the visualization of directory structures. The elements, directories and files, as well as their relations can easily be extracted, thereby showing that the use of methods from botanical modeling can be effective for information visualization.},

Trees and castles show general size effects, the change of whole clusters of variables from point to point, trends, and outliers. They are especially appropriate for evaluating the clustering of variables and for observing clusters of points. Their major advantage over earlier attempts to represent multivariate observations (such as profiles, stars, faces, boxes, and Andrews's curves) lies in their matching of relationships between variables to relationships between features of the representing symbol. Several examples are given, including one with 48 variables.},

By regarding the information structures used in computers as complex objects, we can abstract these objects as well as control their amount. Using our method, (1) the total amount of information is kept nearly constant even when users change their focuses of attention and (2) this amount can be set flexibly. Through mathematical analysis, we show our method's ability to control the amount. An application to program display is also shown. When this method is applied to the display of structured programs, it provides fisheye-like views which integrate local details around the focal point and major landmarks further away.},

  abstract = {Tree and graph structures have been widely used to present hierarchical and linked data. Hyperbolic trees are special types of graphs composed of nodes (points or vertices) and edges (connecting lines), which are visualized on a non-Euclidean space. In traditional Euclidean space graph visualization, distances between nodes are measured by straight lines. Displays of large graphs in Euclidean spaces may not utilize efficiently the available space and may impose limitations on the number of graph nodes. The special hyperbolic space rendering of tree-graphs enables adaptive and efficient use of the available space and facilitates the display of large hierarchical structures. In this paper we report on a newly developed advanced hyperbolic graph viewer, Hyperbolic Wheel, which enables the navigation, traversal, discovery and interactive manipulation of information stored in large hierarchical structures. Examples of such structures include personnel records, disc directory structures, ontological constructs, web-pages and other nested partitions. The Hyperbolic Wheel framework provides an intuitive and dynamic graphical interface to explore and retrieve information about individual nodes (data objects) and their relationships (data associations). The Hyperbolic Wheel is freely available online for educational and research purposes.},

Adjacent child positions are separated by approximately a base spacing.

The layout data can be obtained from data defining the node-link structure. The layout data can be used to perform mappings, each obtaining positions for a subset of the nodes. The layout data can be used to present a first representation of the node-link structure on a display. In response to a user signal indicating a change from a first display position near a first feature to a second display position, a second representation can be presented that is perceptible as a changed continuation of the first. The second representation includes, near the second display position, a second feature representing the same part of the node-link structure as the first feature.

All mid-spacing circles together determine an outer convex hull enclosing a total area for the representation. The mid-spacing circles of a subset of more spaced node features determine an inner convex hull enclosing approximately half the total area and enclosing a region in which nearest node spacings are in general perceptibly greater than in another region outside the second convex hull. The node features also represent a peripheral branch with lower level nodes that are not represented by more spaced node features. In the peripheral branch, node features that share a parent have centers of area positioned approximately along an arc with sufficiently similar spacings from the center of area of the parent node feature and from adjacent node features that they are perceptible as a group of related node features. The inner convex hulls of the first and last representations include subsets of node features representing different sets of nodes. The sequence can produce a perception that one node feature's nearest node spacing increases while another's decreases. The representations can be presented by a series of iterations, and can be presented at animation speeds to produce a perception of continuously moving node features.},

Our work is motivated by the fact that in spite of years of research and practice, software development and maintenance are still time and resource consuming, and high-risk activities. The most important reason in our opinion is the complexity of many phenomena related to software, such as its evolution and its reliability. In fact, there is very little theory explaining them. Today, we have a unique opportunity to empirically study these phenomena, thanks to large sets of software data available through open-source programs and open repositories. Automatic analysis techniques, such as statistics and machine learning, are usually limited when studying phenomena with unknown or poorly-understood influence factors. We claim that hybrid techniques that combine automatic analysis with human expertise through visualization are excellent alternatives to them. In this paper, we propose a visualization framework that supports quality analysis of large-scale software systems.

  abstract = {The 3D tree visualization faces multiples challenges: the election of an appropriate layout, the use of the interactions that make it easier the data exploration and a metaphor that helps the information understanding. A good combination of these three elements (layout, interactions and metaphor) will result in a visualization that effectively convey the key features of a complex structure or system to a wide range of users and permits the analytical reasoning process. The goal of this work was centered in the 3D tree visualization. In spite of their apparent simplicity, the displaying of a tree in 3D can also introduce new problems that can be overcome with the appropriate interactions. So, we have developed a new visualization technique for 3D tree visualization; this includes the design of a new tree layout that we called Spherical layout and the set of interactions that can be applied on this representation. This technique allows representing hierarchical structures to different levels of detail and also can be used as a visualization technique that allows a tree with attribute to be visualized. The Spherical layout has shown good result for large trees without compromising the performance; this is a key issue in tree visualization.},

Because some species are more closely related than others, computing and visualizing these correlations must be done in the context of the evolutionary tree that relates the species. Although dozens of visualizations for correlated traits have been developed over the decades, the recent explosive growth in the number of traits and species has created a need for a visualization that can scale to dozens of traits mapped to thousands of species and their evolutionary tree to allow the interactive exploration of complex interactions. In this paper, we introduce Det., called detective, an evolutionary tree visualization that allows biologists to see multiple attributes of leaf nodes. We describe a new tree layout algorithm to represent different branch lengths and several visualization and intereaction techniques to address user requirements. We also report informal feedbacks we collected from evolutionary biologists.},

However, most existing techniques restrict their partitioning process in vertical and horizontal direction only, which cause problem with identifying hierarchical structures. This paper presents a new space-filling method named Angular Treemaps that relax the constraint of the rectangular subdivision. The approach of Angular Treemaps utilizes divide and conquer paradigm to visualize and emphasize large hierarchical structures within a compact and limited display area with better interpretability. Angular Treemaps generate various layouts to highlight hierarchical sub-structure based on user's preferences or system recommendations. It offers flexibility to be adopted into a wider range of applications, regarding different enclosing shapes. Preliminary usability results suggest user's performance by using this technique is improved in locating and identifying categorized analysis tasks.},

Our approach is based on the combination of Divide-and-Conquer method and the treemap paradigm. The partitioning algorithms generate three types of layouts with polygonal, angular and rectangular titling, which are flexible to be used separately or combined. We present technical details including the visualization results in the experiments and in the cases studies with real data sets. We evaluated the visualization based on graph drawing aesthetics and optimization criteria. Our usability study shows that (1) treemaps with layout variability support utilization of human capability in graph perception and (2) treemaps adopted in different shaped containers could have a positive impact on user satisfaction and awareness during visual data exploration.},

Systematic support for detecting and reacting to critical process and product states in order to achieve planned goals is usually missing.

An SPCC is comparable to a control room, which is a well known term in the mechanical production domain. One crucial task of an SPCC is the systematic visualization of measurement data in order to provide context-, purpose-, and role-oriented information for all stakeholders (e.g., project managers, quality assurance managers, developers) during the execution of a software development project. The article will present an overview of SPCC concepts, a concrete instantiation that supports goal-oriented data visualization, as well as examples and experiences from practical applications.},

Let M be the infinite grid graph with vertex set Z^2, where two vertices (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) of M are adjacent if and only if |x1-x2|+|y1-y2|=1. Suppose that T is a tree which is a subdivision of $T_h$ and is also isomorphic to a subgraph of M. Motivated by issues in optimal VLSI design, we show that the point expansion ratio $n(T)/n(T_h)=n(T)/(2^(h+1)-1)$ is bounded below by 1.122 for h sufficiently large. That is, we give bounds on how many vertices of degree 2 must be inserted along the edges of $T_h$ in order that the resulting tree can be laid out in the grid. Concerning the constructive end of VLSI design, suppose that T is a tree which is a subdivision of $T_h$ and is also isomorphic to a subgraph of the $n\times n$ grid graph. Define the expansion ratio of such a layout to be $n*n/n(T_h)=n*n/(2^(h+1)-1)$. We show constructively that the minimum possible expansion ratio over all layouts of $T_h$ is bounded above by 1.4656 for sufficiently large h. That is, we give efficient layouts of complete binary trees into square grids, making improvements upon the previous work of others. We also give bounds for the point expansion and expansion problems for layouts of Th into extended grids, i.e. grids with added diagonals.},

  abstract = {The majority of program editors available on the market support the view of a directory-explorer style to display only those code lines of interest. Among them, the fisheye and the fractal views of source code (in which each line has a value reflecting the degree of interest and importance) have received a lot of attention in the literature. In information visualization, drawing trees based on fractal theory also plays an interesting role as the so-called balloon drawing of hierarchical data includes two models: the fractal and the SNS (subtrees with nonuniform sizes) models. It is therefore natural to consider a new source code visualization style based on the SNS model of balloon drawing. A main feature of the SNS view is that the value of each line reflects the number of its descendants when the source code is viewed as a tree structure. Unlike the view of a directory-explorer style, the multiscalable font mode (which was originally utilized in the fractal view of source code) displays all the lines in such a way that each line has the font size proportional to its value. In this paper, we investigate various issues concerning the multiscalable font modes of the fish-eye, the fractal, and the SNS views of source code, in hope of providing guidelines for the programmer to better comprehend the program code in practice.},

We present a visualization tool for hierarchical structures that combines the advantages of treemaps and nodelinks by naturally incorporating them into a 3D layout. The nodelink is built upon the treemap in a direction orthogonal to the treemap plane. Our visualization tool supports various navigation techniques suitable for different analysis tasks. First, the user interaction allows users to render subtrees of the nodelink transparently. Second, the various levels can be explored separately in an intuitive fashion by sliding its plane through the orthogonal nodelink layout and, thus, moving the treemap to the respective level of the hierarchy. Third, zooming into regions of interest is supported by using a focus+context technique that operates on the combined 3D layout. We demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our system for visual exploration purposes in a case study that uses our system as a file explorer. In this context, we perform a user study that evaluates our approach and allows for a comparison to other existing approaches.},

Nodes are allocated their areas according to their attribute value, and siblings of same parents are made in ascending order according to the size of areas, adjusting the position of sectors. Meanwhile, based on total number of nodes in each layer, SASA dynamically determines width of this circular ring, following the principle "more nodes wider circular ring and fewer nodes thinner circular ring", and in this way, it can optimize the size of nested ring in Sunburst and improve space utilization rate. Finally, User Locating Efficiency (ULE) and Arc Ratio (AR) is put forward to examine SASA, Experimental results show that this algorithm can indeed optimize sector's arrangement, as well as make space utilization better.},

With the introduction of weighted Venn structures, the contents and relationships of various datasets can be correlated and simultaneously aggregated without losing information. We demonstrate the suitability of this approach using a dataset of 16S rDNA sequences obtained from microbial populations at three different depths of the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea.

  abstract = {Treemaps are an important and commonly-used approach to hierarchy visualization, but an important limitation of treemaps is the difficulty of discerning the structure of a hierarchy. This paper presents cascaded treemaps, a new approach to treemap presentation that is based in cascaded rectangles instead of the traditional nested rectangles. Cascading uses less space to present the same containment relationship, and the space savings enable a depth effect and natural padding between siblings in complex hierarchies. In addition, we discuss two general limitations of existing treemap layout algorithms: disparities between node weight and relative node size that are introduced by layout algorithms ignoring the space dedicated to presenting internal nodes, and a lack of stability when generating views of different levels of treemaps as a part of supporting interactive zooming. We finally present a two-stage layout process that addresses both concerns, computing a stable structure for the treemap and then using that structure to consider the presentation of internal nodes when arranging the treemap. All of this work is presented in the context of two large real-world hierarchies, the Java package hierarchy and the eBay auction hierarchy.},

This paper presents a novel way how views from information visualization can be adapted by the use of the well-known illustrative technique "exploded view", to successfully face the problems described above. The application of exploded views gains screen space for an explanation in a smart way and acts explanatory itself.

These conventions relax the requirement that a parent must be exactly placed midway between its children, and instead make this a preference which can be violated if this is required for the layout to fit into the required width. Both drawing conventions give rise to a simple kind of quadratic programming problem. We give an iterative gradient projection algorithm for solving this kind of problem, and also a linear time heuristic algorithm. Our algorithms are practical: a tree with three thousand nodes can be laid out in less than a hundred milliseconds with either algorithm.},

Also, they cannot reuse layout information when the trees changes, so after every change the layout must be recomputed and the tree redrawn. The main difference between these traditional approaches and the author's approach is that his algorithm is more geometric. Unlike other algorithms, it uses an explicit representation of node and subtree contours, and it stores every contour as a polygon. It has three advantages over traditional algorithms. It allows one to draw trees with nodes of any polygonal shape compactly. The data structure supports insert and delete operations on subtrees. It is simple to implement, yet flexible.},

  abstract = {We present the H3 layout technique for drawing large directed graphs as node-link diagrams in 3D hyperbolic space. We can lay out much larger structures than can be handled using traditional techniques for drawing general graphs because we assume a hierarchical nature of the data. We impose a hierarchy on the graph by using domain-specific knowledge to find an appropriate spanning tree. Links which are not part of the spanning tree do not influence the layout but can be selectively drawn by user request. The volume of hyperbolic 3-space increases exponentially, as opposed to the familiar geometric increase of euclidean 3-space. We exploit this exponential amount of room by computing the layout according to the hyperbolic metric. We optimize the cone tree layout algorithm for 3D hyperbolic space by placing children on a hemisphere around the cone mouth instead of on its perimeter.

  abstract = {Drawing graphs as nodes connected by links is visually compelling but computationally difficult. Hyperbolic space and spanning trees can reduce visual clutter, speed up layout, and provide fluid interaction. This article briefly describes a software system that explicitly attempts to handle much larger graphs than previous systems and support dynamic exploration rather than final presentation. It then discusses the applicability of this system to goals beyond simple exploration. A software system that supports graph exploration should include both a layout and an interactive drawing component. I have developed new algorithms for both layout and drawing (H3 and H3Viewer). The H3Viewer drawing algorithm remains under development, so this article presents preliminary results. I have implemented a software library that uses these algorithms. It can handle graphs of more than 100,000 edges by using a spanning tree as the backbone for the layout and drawing algorithms.},

Both layout and navigation occur in 3D hyperbolic space, which provides a view of a large neighborhood around an easily changeable point of interest. We find an appropriate spanning tree to use as the backbone for fast layout and uncluttered drawing, and non-tree links can be displayed on demand. Our methods are appropriate when node or link annotations can guide the choice of a good parent from among all of the incoming links. Such annotations can be constructed using only a small amount of domain-specific knowledge, thus rendering tractable many graphs which may seem rather densely connected at first glance.},

  school = {Stanford University},
  year = {2000},
  abstract = {Many real-world domains can be represented as large node-link graphs: backbone Internet routers connect with 70,000 other hosts, mid-sized Web servers handle between 20,000 and 200,000 hyperlinked documents, and dictionaries contain millions of words defined in terms of each other. Computational manipulation of such large graphs is common, but previous tools for graph visualization have been limited to datasets of a few thousand nodes. Visual depictions of graphs and networks are external representations that exploit human visual processing to reduce the cognitive load of many tasks that require understanding of global or local structure. We assert that the two key advantages of computer-based systems for information visualization over traditional paper-based visual exposition are interactivity and scalability. We also argue that designing visualization software by taking the characteristics of a target user's task domain into account leads to systems that are more effective and scale to larger datasets than previous work. This thesis contains a detailed analysis of three specialized systems for the interactive exploration of large graphs, relating the intended tasks to the spatial layout and visual encoding choices. We present two novel algorithms for specialized layout and drawing that use quite different visual metaphors. The H3 system for visualizing the hyperlink structures of web sites scales to datasets of over 100,000 nodes by using a carefully chosen spanning tree as the layout backbone, 3D hyperbolic geometry for a Focus+Context view, and provides a fluid interactive experience through guaranteed frame rate drawing. The Constellation system features a highly specialized 2D layout intended to spatially encode domain-specific information for computational linguists checking the plausibility of a large semantic network created from dictionaries. The Planet Multicast system for displaying the tunnel topology of the Internet's multicast backbone provides a literal 3D geographic layout of arcs on a globe to help MBone maintainers find misconfigured long-distance tunnels. Each of these three systems provides a very different view of the graph structure, and we evaluate their efficacy for the intended task. We generalize these findings in our analysis of the importance of interactivity and specialization for graph visualization systems that are effective and scalable.},

  abstract = {Structural comparison of large trees is a difficult task that is only partially supported by current visualization techniques, which are mainly designed for browsing. We present TreeJuxtaposer, a system designed to support the comparison task for large trees of several hundred thousand nodes. We introduce the idea of "guaranteed visibility", where highlighted areas are treated as landmarks that must remain visually apparent at all times. We propose a new methodology for detailed structural comparison between two trees and provide a new nearly-linear algorithm for computing the best corresponding node from one tree to another. In addition, we present a new rectilinear Focus+Context technique for navigation that is well suited to the dynamic linking of side-by-side views while guaranteeing landmark visibility and constant frame rates. These three contributions result in a system delivering a fluid exploration experience that scales both in the size of the dataset and the number of pixels in the display. We have based the design decisions for our system on the needs of a target audience of biologists who must understand the structural details of many phylogenetic, or evolutionary, trees. Our tool is also useful in many other application domains where tree comparison is needed, ranging from network management to call graph optimization to genealogy.},

How to efficiently visualize trees in the learning process, particularly large trees, is still questionable and currently requires efficient tools.

  abstract = {This paper describes a new technique called EncCon for visualizing and navigating large hierarchical information. This technique consists of two components: visualization and navigation. Visualization uses a fast enclosure+connection method to calculate the geometrical layout for the display of large hierarchies in a two-dimensional space. Our technique uses a rectangular division algorithm for recursively positioning the graph. This visualization aims to maximize the utilization of display space while retaining a good geometrical layout as well as a clear (explicit) presentation of the hierarchical structure of graphs. This paper also presents an experimental evaluation of EncCon's layout algorithm. Besides the layout algorithm, EncCon uses a new focus+context viewing technique for the navigation of large hierarchies. We use the zooming+layering concept to achieve the focus+context viewing, rather than the traditional enlarge+embedded concept, which is used by most of the available focus+context techniques. Technically, it employs semi-transparency to achieve the display of two layers of information in z-coordination at the same visualization. Both context view and detail view are drawn at two separate layers. These layers are then displayed in an overlapped manner at the same physical screen space.},

Such a partition consists of a hierarchy of convex polygons, each having small aspect ratio, and satisfying specified volume constraints. We apply these partitions to obtain a natural extension of the popular Treemap visualization method. Our proposed algorithm is not constrained in using only rectangles, and can achieve provably better guarantees on the aspect ratio of the constructed polygons.  Under relaxed conditions, we can also construct circular partitions in higher-dimensional spaces. We use these relaxed partitions to obtain improved approximation algorithms for embedding ultrametrics into d-dimensional Euclidean space. In particular, we give a polylog(Delta)-approximation algorithm for embedding n-point ultrametrics into R^d with minimum distortion (Delta denotes the spread of the metric). The previously best-known approximation ratio for this problem was polynomial in n. This is the first algorithm for embedding a non-trivial family of weighted graph metrics into a space of constant dimension that achieves polylogarithmic approximation ratio.},

  title = {{CGD} -- A New Algorithm to Optimize Space Occupation in Ellimaps},
  pages = {805--818},
  abstract = {How to visualize datasets hierarchically structured is a basic issue in information visualization. Compared to the common diagrams based on the nodes-links paradigm (e.g. trees), the enclosure-based methods have shown high potential to represent simultaneously the structure of the hierarchy and the weight of nodes. In addition, these methods often support scalability up to sizes where trees become very complicated to understand. Several approaches belong to this class of visualization methods such as treemaps, ellimaps, circular treemaps or Voronoi treemaps. This paper focuses on the specific case of ellimaps in which the nodes are represented by ellipses nested one into each other. A controlled experiment has previously shown that the initial version of the ellimaps was efficient to support the perception of the dataset structure and was reasonably acceptable for the perception of the node weights. However it suffers from a major drawback in terms of display space occupation. We have tackled this issue and the paper proposes a new algorithm to draw ellimaps. It is based on successive distortions and relocations of the ellipses in order to occupy a larger proportion of the display space than the initial algorithm. A Monte-Carlo simulation has been used to evaluate the filling ratio of the display space in this new approach. The results show a significant improvement of this factor.},

  abstract = {An alternative form to multidimensional projections for the visual analysis of data represented in multidimensional spaces is the deployment of similarity trees, such as Neighbor Joining trees. They organize data objects on the visual plane emphasizing their levels of similarity with high capability of detecting and separating groups and subgroups of objects. Besides this similarity-based hierarchical data organization, some of their advantages include the ability to decrease point clutter; high precision; and a consistent view of the data set during focusing, offering a very intuitive way to view the general structure of the data set as well as to drill down to groups and subgroups of interest. Disadvantages of similarity trees based on neighbor joining strategies include their computational cost and the presence of virtual nodes that utilize too much of the visual space. This paper presents a highly improved version of the similarity tree technique. The improvements in the technique are given by two procedures. The first is a strategy that replaces virtual nodes by promoting real leaf nodes to their place, saving large portions of space in the display and maintaining the expressiveness and precision of the technique. The second improvement is an implementation that significantly accelerates the algorithm, impacting its use for larger data sets. We also illustrate the applicability of the technique in visual data mining, showing its advantages to support visual classification of data sets, with special attention to the case of image classification. We demonstrate the capabilities of the tree for analysis and iterative manipulation and employ those capabilities to support evolving to a satisfactory data organization and classification.},

  title = {Quantitative visualizations of hierarchically organized data in a geographic context},
  abstract = {Here we introduce a novel quantitative technique for visualizing hierarchically organized data in a geographic context. In contrast to existing techniques, our visualization emphasizes the hierarchical relationships in the data by depicting them in a standard tree format that takes advantage of many fundamental perceptual properties. Our technique allows users to define a geographic axis and visualize how well a tree correlates with the ordering of geographical locations along this axis. This is accomplished by finding the ordering of leaf nodes, subject to the constraints of the tree topology, which minimizes the number of crossings that occur between lines that connect leaf nodes to their associated geographic locations. In this optimal layout, any crossings that occur between these lines indicate discordance between the topology of the tree and the user defined geographic axis. We have developed a branch-and-bound algorithm that allows optimal leaf orderings to be determined quickly enough to support interactive exploration of different geographic axes even for large multifurcating hierarchies. The quantitative nature of our visualization has allowed us to specify a permutation test for determining if the relationship between a tree topology and a geographic axis is statistically significant. In this paper, the utility of our visualization is demonstrated on biological data sets, but our method is applicable to any hierarchical data where geographic structure may be of interest.},

Essential bioinformatic and statistical tools are integrated into the software, allowing the user a wide range of analysis options for their sequence data. Data visualizations are combined with the cartographic display to yield a clear view of the relationship between geography and genomic diversity, with a particular focus on the hierarchical clustering of sites based on their similarity or phylogenetic proximity.

Our system is similar to the radial layout system of Yee et al. (2001), but differs primarily in that each node is positioned on a coordinate system centered on its own parent rather than on a single coordinate system for all nodes. Our system is thus easy to define recursively and lends itself to parallelization. It also guarantees that layouts have many nice properties, such as: it guarantees certain edges never cross during an animation. We compared the layouts and transitions produced by our algorithms to those produced by Yee et al. Results from several experiments indicate that our system produces fewer edge crossings during transitions between graph drawings, and that the transitions more often involve changes in local scaling rather than structure. These findings suggest the system has promise as an interactive graph exploration tool in a variety of settings.},

We provide a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for this problem. This result applies to any tree for tip-over layouts and to bounded degree trees in the case of the inclusion convention. We also prove that such restriction is necessary since, for unbounded degree trees, the inclusion problem is strongly NP-hard. Hence, neither a fully polynomial time approximation scheme nor a pseudopolynomial time algorithm exists, unless P=NP. Our technique, combined with the parallel algorithm by Metaxas et al., also yields an NC fully parallel approximation scheme. This latter result holds for inclusion of binary trees and for the slicing floorplanning problem. Although this problem is in P, it is unknown whether it belongs to NC or not. All the above results also apply to other size functions of the drawing (e.g., the perimeter).},

  abstract = {The well-known ReingoldTilford algorithm produces tidy-layered drawings of trees: drawings where all nodes at the same depth are vertically aligned. However, when nodes have varying heights, layered drawing may use more vertical space than necessary. A non-layered drawing of a tree places children at a fixed distance from the parent, thereby giving a more vertically compact drawing. Moreover, non-layered drawings can also be used to draw trees where the vertical position of each node is given, by adding dummy nodes. In this paper, we present the first linear-time algorithm for producing non-layered drawings. Our algorithm is a modification of the ReingoldTilford algorithm, but the original complexity proof of the ReingoldTilford algorithm uses an invariant that does not hold for the non-layered case. We give an alternative proof of the algorithm and its extension to non-layered drawings. To improve drawings of trees of unbounded degree, extensions to the ReingoldTilford algorithm have been proposed. These extensions also work in the non-layered case, but we show that they then cause a $O(n^2)$ run-time. We then propose a modification to these extensions that restores the $O(n)$ run-time.},

  year = {1994},
  abstract = {A processor presents a sequence of images of a hierarchical structure that is perceived as three-dimensional. The hierarchical structure includes conic substructures that can have vertical or horizontal axes. Each cone has a parent node at its vertex and children nodes along its base, each with a link to the parent node. Each child can in turn be at the vertex of another cone. The cones can be rotated in steps that produce the perception of object constancy for each node. For example, if the user requests that an indicated node be moved to a primary viewing position, each of the cones along the path from the indicated node to the root node is rotated in the direction that most directly moves the indicated node to the primary viewing position. Each node can include a selectable unit for indicating it, and a node can also include a grow tab that can be selected to request presentation of its children nodes and links to them. The user can request that the children nodes of a node be replaced by a grow tab. To reduce the computation necessary for each step of rotation, the position relative to a cone's axis for each of 80 points on the base of a cone is computed for a level of the hierarchy and is then stored in an array for subsequent use in positioning nodes on that level. The base point of each node on a rotating cone can then be changed in a linked node data structure, and its new position can then be obtained by simple arithmetic operations using the axis coordinates and the appropriate data from the array. The base of each array can be a polygon whose vertices are nodes, and the base shape can be presented as a shadow to provide additional information and strengthen the perception of three dimensions. Or, the profiles of the cones can be presented as a shadow.},

Unfortunately, the algorithm of [2] is not suitable for practical use. The main problem is that the constant hidden in the "Oh " notation for area is quite large (for binary trees was 3900). In this paper, we have made several improvements to the algorithm, which make it suitable for practical use. We have also conducted an experiment on this newer version of the algorithm for randomly-generated general trees with up to 50,000 nodes.

Alternatively, it can display more information to the user in the same amount of screen space as comparable systems. Moreover, although the present invention is disclosed herein in connection with visualizing Web data, it can be applied to portray any information hierarchy.},

In order to provide the possibility of interactively customizing a tree layout, we offer a free-form sketch-based interaction through which one can re-define the boundary constraints for the tree layouts by combining ray-line intersection and line segment intersection. Flexible Trees offer topology preserving adjustments; can be used with a variety of tree layouts; and offer a simple way of authoring tree layouts for infographic purposes.},

However, network visualization is not ideal for studying individuals and comparing their social behavior and relationships with others based on data with rich attributes. In this paper, we present ContactTree, a new ego-centered visualization technique designed to reveal patterns and trends in the data, and to facilitate reasoning about patterns or trends as well as comparison of interpersonal ties and contacts. The technique is based on a botanical tree metaphor. The tree is easy to construct and the resulting tree-like visualization can display many properties of the data. We have conducted two case studies to validate our method. The first study is based on a dataset consisting of two waves of 3-month contact diaries over 2004-2008. The second study uses a co-author network consisting of mainly information visualization researchers.},

Prioritization rules ensure that less characteristic, peripheral rings are removed first. All scaffolds in the hierarchy tree are well-defined chemical entities making the classification chemically intuitive. The classification is deterministic, data-set-independent, and scales linearly with the number of compounds included in the data set. The application of the classification is demonstrated on two data sets extracted from the PubChem database, namely, pyruvate kinase binders and a collection of pesticides. The examples shown demonstrate that the classification procedure handles robustly synthetic structures and natural products.},

For that purpose, we first establish the design space along the four axes of dimensionality, edge representation, node representation, and layout by examining most of the existing implicit hierarchy visualization techniques. The survey is completed by an outlook to the so far unexplored regions of the design space by giving a few examples of novel combinations of design parameters. Furthermore, we ensure that our design space is not a mere theoretical construct, but a practically usable tool for rapid visualization development by discussing and presenting a concrete software implementation of the introduced design space.},

  abstract = {In response to the large number of existing tree layouts, generic ``meta-layouts'' have recently been proposed. These generic approaches utilize layout design spaces to pinpoint a tree drawing with desired characteristics in the wealth of available drawing options and parameters. While design-space-based generic layouts work well for the confined set of implicit space-filling tree layouts, they have so far eluded their extension to explicit node-link diagrams. In order to produce both, implicit and explicit tree layouts, this paper parts with the descriptive nature of the design spaces and instead takes a generative approach based on operators. As these operators can be combined into operator sequences and be used at different stages of the layout process, a small operator set already suffices to yield a large number of different tree layouts. To this end, we present a generic tree layout pipeline and give examples of suitable layout operators to plug into the pipeline. A prototypical implementation of our pipeline and operators is presented, and it is illustrated with space-filling and node-link examples. Furthermore, the paper presents results from a user study evaluating our generative approach as it is realized by the prototype.},

Several algorithms have been proposed to create more useful displays by controlling the aspect ratios of the rectangles that make up a treemap. While these algorithms do improve visibility of small items in a single layout, they introduce instability over time in the display of dynamically changing data, and fail to preserve an ordering of the underlying data. This paper introduces the ordered treemap, which addresses these two shortcomings. The ordered treemap algorithm ensures that items near each other in the given order will be near each other in the treemap layout. Using experimental evidence from Monte Carlo trials, we show that compared to other layout algorithms ordered treemaps are more stable while maintaining relatively favorable aspect ratios of the constituent rectangles. A second test set uses stock market data.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate and reflect upon the use of enhanced treemaps that incorporate spatial and temporal ordering for exploring a large multivariate spatio-temporal data set. The resulting data-dense views summarise and simultaneously present hundreds of space-, time-, and variable-constrained subsets of a large multivariate data set in a structure that facilitates their meaningful comparison and supports visual analysis. Interactive techniques allow localised patterns to be explored and subsets of interest selected and compared with the spatial aggregate. Spatial variation is considered through interactive raster maps and high-resolution local road maps. The techniques are developed in the context of 42.2 million records of vehicular activity in a 98 sqkm area of central London and informally evaluated through a design used in the exploratory visualisation of this data set. The main advantages of our technique are the means to simultaneously display hundreds of summaries of the data and to interactively browse hundreds of variable combinations with ordering and symbolism that are consistent and appropriate for space- and time-based variables. These capabilities are difficult to achieve in the case of spatio-temporal data with categorical attributes using existing geovisualisation methods. We acknowledge limitations in the treemap representation but enhance the cognitive plausibility of this popular layout through our two-dimensional ordering algorithm and interactions. Patterns that are expected (e.g. more traffic in central London), interesting (e.g. the spatial and temporal distribution of particular vehicle types) and anomalous (e.g. low speeds on particular road sections) are detected at various scales and locations using the approach. In many cases, anomalies identify biases that may have implications for future use of the data set for analyses and applications. Ordered treemaps appear to have potential as interactive interfaces for variable selection in spatio-temporal visualisation.},

These density-normalising cartograms size spatial units by population, increasing the ease with which data for densely populated areas can be visually resolved compared to more conventional cartographic projections. Their hierarchical nature enables the study of spatial granularity in spatial hierarchies, hierarchical categorical data and multivariate data through false hierarchies. They are space-filling representations that make efficient use of space and their rectangular nature (which aims to be as square as possible) improves the ability to compare the sizes (therefore population) of geographical units. We demonstrate these cartograms by mapping the Office for National Statistics Output Area Classification (OAC) by unit postcode (1.52 million in Great Britain) through the postcode hierarchy, using these to explore spatial variation. We provide rich and detailed spatial summaries of socio-economic characteristics of population as types of treemap, exploring the effects of reconfiguring them to study spatial and non-spatial aspects of the OAC classification.},

  abstract = {Treemaps are a popular tool to visualize hierarchical data: items are represented by nested rectangles and the area of each rectangle corresponds to the data being visualized for this item. The visual quality of a treemap is commonly measured via the aspect ratio of the rectangles. If the data changes, then a second important quality criterion is the stability of the treemap: how much does the treemap change as the data changes. We present a novel stable treemapping algorithm that has very high visual quality. Whereas existing treemapping algorithms generally recompute the treemap every time the input changes, our algorithm changes the layout of the treemap using only local modifications. This approach not only gives us direct control over stability, but it also allows us to use a larger set of possible layouts, thus provably resulting in treemaps of higher visual quality compared to existing algorithms. We further prove that we can reach all possible treemap layouts using only our local modifications. Furthermore, we introduce a new measure for stability that better captures the relative positions of rectangles. We finally show via experiments on real-world data that our algorithm outperforms existing treemapping algorithms also in practice on either visual quality and/or stability. Our algorithm scores high on stability regardless of whether we use an existing stability measure or our new measure.},

  abstract = {One of the main tasks in information visualisation research is creating visual tools to facilitate human understanding of large and complex information spaces. Hierarchies, being a good mechanism for organising such information, are ubiquitous. Although much research effort has been spent on finding useful representations for hierarchies, visualising large hierarchies is still a difficult topic. One of the difficulties is how to handle the ever increasing scale of hierarchies. Another is how to enable the user to focus on multiple selections of interest while maintaining context. This paper describes a hierarchy visualisation technique called FlexTree to address these problems. It contains some important features that have not been exploited so far. A profile or contour unique to the hierarchy being visualised can be viewed in a bar chart layout. A normalised view of a common attribute of all nodes can be selected by the user. Multiple foci are consistently accessible within a global context through interaction. Furthermore it can handle a large hierarchy that contains 10,000 nodes in a PC environment. This technique has been applied to visualise computer file system structures and decision trees from data mining results. The results from informal user evaluations against these two applications are also presented. User feedback suggests that FlexTree is suitable for visualising large decision trees.},

Therefore handling hierarchical data structures becomes an important task in the field of information visualization.

We propose a technique named Rectangular Tree Browser for the visualization and navigation of large hierarchies. The technique lays out the tree on an imaginary geometrical plane with the root in the center, and then transforms and maps the plane to a limited rectangle area rather than an ellipse area as Hyperbolic Browser does. Comparing with Hyperbolic Browser, our browser makes better use of the display space. Moreover, because regular user interface components are rectangular, by doing this transformation, the browser is easy to be integrated into a user interface that contains more components. We conducted an informal user test with five users performing navigation and selection tasks. Through observation and interview, we found that our users didn't experience any uncomfortability. We believe that Rectangular Tree Browser has the potential to be a good tool for navigation and visualization of large hierarchies.},

Performance with Treemap tended to improve over time and use, suggesting a greater learning cost that was partially recouped over time. Each tool afforded somewhat different search strategies, which also appeared to influence performance.

Second, it makes history directly visible in the city layouts, which allows for supporting novel analysis scenarios. We illustrate such scenarios by presenting several thematic cities maps, each capturing specific development history aspects.},

In these games, players make predictions on a tournament bracket that defines which competitors play each other and how they proceed toward a single champion. Throughout the course of the tournament, players monitor the brackets to track progress and to compare predictions made by multiple players. This is often a complex sense making task. The classic bracket visualization was designed for use on paper and utilizes an incrementally additive system in which the winner of each match-up is rewritten in the next round as the tournament progresses. Unfortunately, this representation requires a significant amount of space and makes it relatively difficult to get a quick overview of the tournament state since competitors take arbitrary paths through the static bracket. In this paper, we present AdaptiviTree, a novel visualization that adaptively deforms the representation of the tree and uses its shape to convey outcome information. AdaptiviTree not only provides a more compact and understandable representation, but also allows overlays that display predictions as well as other statistics. We describe results from a lab study we conducted to explore the efficacy of AdaptiviTree, as well as from a deployment of the system in a recent real-world sports tournament.},

A 2D visualization tool for hierarchical information called treemap has already been proposed by Ben Shneiderman, et al. in 1992. In general, hierarchical information is represented as a tree structure. Treemap hierarchically lays out each node as a bounding box, whose size is the same as the specific weight or attribute value of the node. After the original treemap algorithm called slice-and-dice, some extensions to it have been proposed: squarified treemap, ordered treemap and strip treemap. Furthermore, quantum treemap is a quantization version of these extensions. In this paper, the authors propose a new 3D visualization tool for hierarchical information called treecube that can be taken as a 3D extension of treemap. Especially, this paper shows its usefulness for browsing 3D multimedia data, i.e., 2D images, 3D shape models, motion data, etc., originally stored in a file system.},

  title = {Interactive Interfaces of Treecube for Browsing {3D} Multimedia Data},
  pages = {298--302},
  abstract = {The authors of this paper have already proposed Treecube which is a visualization tool for browsing 3D multimedia data. In this paper, the authors also propose its interactive interfaces for efficiently browsing 3D multimedia data. Treecube is regarded as a 3D extension of treemap, which is a visualization tool for hierarchical information proposed by Ben Shneiderman et al. in 1992. For treemap, there are several layout algorithms: slice-and-dice, ordered treemap, strip treemap and so on. Furthermore, quantum treemap exists. It means a quantization version of these treemap layout algorithms. The authors implemented mainly three layout algorithms, i.e., slice-and-dice, ordered and strip treecube algorithm, and implemented their quantization version. Practically sophisticated interfaces are necessary for efficiently browsing 3D multimedia data. In this paper, the authors also propose such interfaces. The authors implemented mainly five interface functionalities for the following operations. (1) "Cutting plane" concept to solve the occlusion problem, i.e., nodes located before the plane are hidden to make it easy to see inside nodes. (2) The control of node frames, i.e., their brightness and thickness, for easily understanding the hierarchical structure of nodes. (3) Standard operations for the translation and the rotation of an eye position, and for the zoom in/out. (4) Particular operations for the extraction of the user focus node and for the backward/forward for browsing such node. The authors also implemented (5) a function to assign color information to any node properties because color is the most important factor of the visual display properties.},

  pages = {143-150},
  abstract = {For successfully competing in a modern economy, large amounts of hierarchic time-dependent data need to be analyzed. As an example, one could consider the geographic composition of inflation in the European Union, or the revenue by product (sub) categories of a firm in the last month. Analysts wish to interpret the structure of the data not only at a single point in time, but examine the changes in the data categories through time. The analysts may need to consider additional dimensions to composition and time, such as the growth rate or profit rate. To reflect such analytic requirements, we have developed an interactive visualization of multi-dimensional, structured data taking the time dimension into account. The data are displayed in a three dimensional hierarchic circular or column plot. The time dimension of the data is represented by animation. Our system provides interactive tools for the visual data analysis and variable set-up of the data display. For better orientation in the data space, we have enhanced the visualization with smooth transitions between different data selections in case of 3D hierarchic plots. The techniques presented can be applied to various data domains. A user study using European inflation data has shown the usefulness for effective economic analysis.},

A partial hierarchy is generated and displayed. The partial hierarchy consists of a number levels at least equal to a predetermined depth and less than a total number of levels included in a corresponding complete hierarchy. Parent nodes in the bottom level of the partial hierarchy have segments of connection lines extending toward child nodes not included in the partial hierarchy. A user is permitted to mark selected nodes or locations in a displayed partial hierarchy. Partial hierarchies are generated and stored in a cache or generated on-the-fly. Each partial hierarchy ends at a progressively deeper level. An interpolator interpolates a partial hierarchy layout by interpolating corresponding nodes in two partial hierarchies. A hierarchy manager manages partial hierarchies in response to requests from a viewer to move a camera to camera positions. Partial hierarchies are fetched from the cache or the interpolator. A display then displays display views of fetched partial hierarchies corresponding to the camera positions. During free-form navigation, a hierarchy manager determines and maintain an orientation based on at least one reference object. During zooming, an angular orientation is maintained through successive partial hierarchies. Mapping is also provided between a three-dimensional 3D partial hierarchy and a two-dimensional 2D overview of a complete hierarchy.},

When viewing the treemaps side by side or back and forth, there exist several problems that can prevent viewers from performing effective comparisons. Those problems include abrupt layout changes, a lack of prominent visual patterns to represent layouts, and a lack of direct contrast to highlight differences. In this paper, we present strategies to visualize changes of hierarchical data using treemaps. A new treemap layout algorithm is presented to reduce abrupt layout changes and produce consistent visual patterns. Techniques are proposed to effectively visualize the difference and contrast between two treemap snapshots in terms of the map items' colors, sizes, and positions. Experimental data show that our algorithm can achieve a good balance in maintaining a treemap's stability, continuity, readability, and average aspect ratio. A software tool is created to compare treemaps and generate the visualizations. User studies show that the users can better understand the changes in the hierarchy and layout, and more quickly notice the color and size differences using our method.},

  abstract = {Public genealogical databases are becoming increasingly populated with historical data and records of the current population's ancestors. As this increasing amount of available information is used to link individuals to their ancestors, the resulting trees become deeper and more dense, which justifies the need for using organized, space-efficient layouts to display the data. Existing layouts are often only able to show a small subset of the data at a time. As a result, it is easy to become lost when navigating through the data or to lose sight of the overall tree structure. On the contrary, leaving space for unknown ancestors allows one to better understand the tree's structure, but leaving this space becomes expensive and allows fewer generations to be displayed at a time. In this work, we propose that the H-tree based layout be used in genealogical software to display ancestral trees. We will show that this layout presents an increase in the number of displayable generations, provides a nicely arranged, symmetrical, intuitive and organized fractal structure, increases the user's ability to understand and navigate through the data, and accounts for the visualization requirements necessary for displaying such trees. Finally, user-study results indicate potential for user acceptance of the new layout.},

We show how existing email clients and prior research projects implicitly support each model to a greater or lesser degree depending on their design, but none fully supports both models simultaneously. We present a mixed-model visualization that simultaneously presents sequence and reply relationships among the messages of a conversation, making both visible at a glance. We describe the integration of the visualization into a working prototype email client. A usability study indicates that the system meets our usability goals and verifies that the visualization fully conveys both types of relationships within the messages of an email conversation.},

They reduce visual clutter by bundling lines smoothly and avoiding self-intersections. To capture these properties, our angle-restricted Steiner arborescences, or flux trees, connect several targets to a source with a tree of minimal length whose arcs obey a certain restriction on the angle they form with the source. We study the properties of optimal flux trees and show that they are planar and consist of logarithmic spirals and straight lines. Flux trees have the shallow-light property. We show that computing optimal flux trees is NP-hard. Hence we consider a variant of flux trees which uses only logarithmic spirals. Spiral trees approximate flux trees within a factor depending on the angle restriction. Computing optimal spiral trees remains NP-hard, but we present an efficient 2-approximation, which can be extended to avoid "positive monotone"' obstacles.},

Since all the displayed items are in a polar coordinate system, many interface and visualization schemes must be revisited to account for this new layout of UI elements. We discuss the direct implications of such a circular interface on document orientation. We describe two types of fisheye deformation of the circular layout and explain how to use them in a multi-person collaborative interface. These two schemes provide a general layout framework for circular interfaces. We have also designed a new visualization technique derived from the particularities of the circular layout we have highlighted. In this technique the user controls the layout of the elements of a hierarchical tree. Our approach is to provide the user rich interaction possibilities to easily and quickly produce a layout comparable to the hyperbolic view developed at Xerox PARC.

These familiar visualizations are effective for providing overviews, but fall short for the presentation of large amounts of detailed information. Treemaps can provide such detail, but are often not easy to understand. We present how standard treemap algorithms can be adapted such that the results mimic familiar business graphics. Specifically, we present the use of different layout algorithms per level, a number of variations of the squarified algorithm, the use of variable borders, and the use of non-rectangular shapes. The combined use of these leads to histograms, pie charts and a variety of other styles.},

  volume = {20},
  pages = {685--705},
  number = {7},
  abstract = {Drawing a tree consists of two stages: determining the position of each node, and actually rendering the individuals nodes and interconnecting branches. The algorithm described in this paper is concerned with the first stage: given a list of nodes, an indication of the hierarchical relationship among them, and their shape and size, where should each node be positioned for optimal aesthetic effect? This algorithm determines the positions of the nodes for any arbitrary general tree. It is the most desirable positioning with respect to certain widely-accepted heuristics. The positioning, specified in x, y co-ordinates, minimizes the width of the tree. In a general tree, there is no limit on the number of offspring per node; this contrasts with binary and ternary trees, for example, which are trees with a limit of two and three offspring per node. This algorithm operates in time O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Previously, most tree drawings have been positioned by the sure hand of a human graphic designer. Many computer-generated positionings have been either trivial or contained irregularities. Earlier work by Wetherell and Shannon1 and Tilford,2 upon which this algorithm builds, failed to position the interior nodes of some trees correctly. The algorithm presented here correctly positions a tree's node using only two passes. It also handles several practical considerations: alternative orientations of the tree, variable node sizes and out-of-bounds conditions. Radack, also building on Tilford's work, has solved this same problem with a different algorithm which makes four passes.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel space partitioning strategy for implicit hierarchy visualization such that the new plot not only has a tidy layout similar to the treemap, but also is flexible to data changes similar to the Voronoi treemap. To achieve this, we define a new distance function and neighborhood relationship between sites so that space will be divided by axis-aligned segments. Then a sweepline+skyline based heuristic algorithm is proposed to allocate the partitioned spaces to form an orthogonal Voronoi diagram with orthogonal rectangles. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to use a sweepline-based strategy for the Voronoi treemap. Moreover, we design a novel strategy to initialize the diagram status and modify the status update procedure so that the generation of our plot is more effective and efficient. We show that the proposed algorithm has an O(nlog(n)) complexity which is the same as the state-of-the-art Voronoi treemap. To this end, we show via experiments on the artificial dataset and real-world dataset the performance of our algorithm in terms of computation time, converge rate, and aspect ratio. Finally, we discuss the pros and cons of our method and make a conclusion.},

One successful approach to assess design quality is based on detection strategies, which are metrics-based composed logical conditions, by which design fragments with specific properties are detected in the source code. Such detection strategies, when executed on large software systems usually return large sets of artifacts, which potentially exhibit one or more "design disharmonies", which are then inspected manually, a cumbersome activity. In this article we present disharmony maps, a visualization-based approach to locate such flawed software artifacts in large systems.

We enrich such visualizations with the results returned by a number of detection strategies, and thus render both the static structure and the design problems that affect a subject system.

The current work introduces the concept of equal-height, variable-width cells in treemaps, which affords the packing of multiple variables into the cell areas of the terminals of the hierarchy. We demonstrate how color and some largely width-invariant graphs can be utilized in the cell areas to add additional visual information in a multi-variate treemap.

It is suitable for the arrangement of data with a geographic component and can be used to create tessellated car tograms for geovisualization. Locational consistency is measured and visualized and a number of layout algorithms are compared.

  pages = {986--995},
  abstract = {We present an incremental tree editor based on algorithms for manipulating shape functions. The tree layout is hierarchical, left-to-right. Nodes of variable size and shape are supported. The paper presents algorithms for basic tree editing operations, including cut and paste. The layout algorithm for positioning child-subtrees rooted at a given parent is incrementally recomputed with each edit operation; it attempts to conserve the total display area allocated to child-subtrees while preserving the users mental map. The runtime and space efficiency is good as a result of exploiting a specially designed Shape abstraction for encoding and manipulating the geometric boundaries of subtrees as monotonic step functions to determine their best placement. All tree operations, including loading, saving trees to files, and incremental cut and paste, are worst case O(N) in time, but typically cut and paste are O(log(N)2), where N is the number of nodes.},

  title = {The Perceptual Eye View: A User-Defined Method for Information Visualization},
  pages = {181--190},
  abstract = {With the growing volumes of data, exploring the relationships within the huge amounts of data is difficult. Information visualization uses the human perception system to assist users in analyzing complex relationships and graphical hierarchy trees used commonly to present the relationship among the data. Conventional information visualization approaches fail to consider human factors, they only provide fixed degree of detail to different users. However, different users have different perceptions. A well-known information visualization called 'Magic Eye View' uses a three-dimensional interaction to allow the user to control the degree of detail he would like. However, it fails to consider some important focus+context features such as the smooth transition of the focus region and the global context. In this paper, we propose a novel information visualization method, called the 'Perceptual Eye View,' by which users may control the focus points three-dimensionally enabling different users to view their user-defined degree of detail of information space and to perceive based on their own knowledge and perception. The results demonstrate that our proposed method improve the 'Magic Eye View' by providing smooth transition of the focus region and the global context, which are important focus+context features that the 'Magic Eye View' fails to consider.},

  abstract = {Understanding co-occurrence in urban human mobility (i.e. people from two regions visit an urban place during the same time span) is of great value in a variety of applications, such as urban planning, business intelligence, social behavior analysis, as well as containing contagious diseases. In recent years, the widespread use of mobile phones brings an unprecedented opportunity to capture large-scale and fine-grained data to study co-occurrence in human mobility. However, due to the lack of systematic and efficient methods, it is challenging for analysts to carry out in-depth analyses and extract valuable information. In this paper, we present TelCoVis, an interactive visual analytics system, which helps analysts leverage their domain knowledge to gain insight into the co-occurrence in urban human mobility based on telco data. Our system integrates visualization techniques with new designs and combines them in a novel way to enhance analysts' perception for a comprehensive exploration. In addition, we propose to study the correlations in co-occurrence (i.e. people from multiple regions visit different places during the same time span) by means of biclustering techniques that allow analysts to better explore coordinated relationships among different regions and identify interesting patterns. The case studies based on a real-world dataset and interviews with domain experts have demonstrated the effectiveness of our system in gaining insights into co-occurrence and facilitating various analytical tasks.},

  abstract = {Visualization of distributed processes is useful for the management of large-scale distributed computing systems. Reactivity and scalability are especially important requirements for such visualization of distributed processes. We have proposed the visualization technique "Data Jewelry Box" algorithm, which satisfies both of the above requirements. The technique can be applied for the visualization of distributed processes, however, the algorithm has a problem that may yield much different data layouts even among very similar datasets. This is a serious issue for the seamless visualization of time-varying data. To solve the problem, we propose the extension of "Data Jewelry Box" algorithm. The extension places data elements referring positions of the previous data layout, so that the extension can yield similar layouts among similar datasets. We introduce the extended algorithm, and propose the visualization system for distributed computing systems using the extended algorithm.},

By utilizing the display space with traditional node-link visualization, we have developed a novel method for visualizing tree structures with high scalability.

This paper presents Cabinet Tree, an approach that: i) draws branches explicitly to show relational structures, ii) adapts a space-optimized layout for leaves and maximizes the space utilization, iii) uses coloring and labeling strategies to clearly reveal patterns and contrast different attributes intuitively. We also apply the continuous node selection and detail window techniques to support user interaction with different levels of the hierarchies. Our quantitative evaluations demonstrate that Cabinet Tree achieves good scalability for increased resolutions and big datasets.},

  pages = {137--142},
  abstract = {Hierarchical information is ubiquitous, and analysing such information is one of the common tasks performed by its users. Map-like visualisations, which resemble geographic maps, can be a useful tool for perceiving hierarchical information. Maps have the advantage that the majority of ordinary users can easily understand them without prior training. This paper presents a novel method for visualising hierarchical data in a form resembling a geographic map, using hexagon tiling. Our method can be used for visualising general hierarchical data, such as organisational structures, library catalogues, file systems, and many more. Like treemaps, our new method is area-based, thus it not only reveals hierarchy but also other attributes. Unlike treemaps, however, our method produces visualisations that resemble geographic maps in shape and appearance. Several tactics are employed to control the space-division process and aspect ratio. In this paper we present experiments involving our visualisation, evaluations of results, comparisons with other methods, and discuss advantages and potential issues.},

The clustering on the top map provides general improvements in retrieval recall, while the lower-level nested maps further elaborate the clusters into more specific groups enhancing retrieval precision. The results of preliminary evaluation showed that NSSOM is capable of enhancing precision without sacrificing recall. In addition, a user-friendly browsing facility has also been developed which helps users predict the desired components by providing an intelligible search space. The present approach attempts to achieve an optimal combination of efficiency, accuracy and user-friendliness, which is not offered by the existing software retrieval systems.},

A taxonomy is developed to characterize the design space of such hybrid combinations.
